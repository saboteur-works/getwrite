/**
 * @module preload
 *
 * The desktop bridge exposed to the renderer.
 *
 * This file was deliberately empty until the workspace-location setting needed
 * a native directory picker, which the web app cannot open for itself. It stays
 * as small as that requirement allows: three named channels, no general-purpose
 * `invoke` passthrough, and nothing that touches the filesystem directly. A
 * bridge that can be asked to do anything is a bridge that can be asked to do
 * something regrettable by whatever ends up running in the renderer.
 *
 * `window.getwriteDesktop` existing is also how the UI knows it is running in
 * the desktop app at all — the previous signal, `GETWRITE_DESKTOP`, is
 * server-side only and invisible to a client component.
