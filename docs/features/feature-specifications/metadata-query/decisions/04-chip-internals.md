# Chip Internals

The field/operator/value triad inside each chip. Operator vocabulary and
value-input shape are both derived from the field's type — using the
existing `MetadataFieldType` enum from `schemas.ts`, not invented type
names.

Read `09-current-state.md` first. Field types listed below are the only
ones that exist; anything else would be a new field-type addition,
which is out of scope for the query layer.

## Decisions

### Anatomy

Each chip is three slots: field, operator, value.

```
[ wordCount   is less than   500  ]
  └─ field ──┘└─ operator ─┘└val─┘
```

Choosing the field first determines available operators and the value-
input type. Polarity (`is` / `is not`, `does` / `does not`) lives inside
the operator label, not as a separate toggle.

### Operator vocabularies, by field type

Vocabularies are pinned to the existing `MetadataFieldType` enum.
Every type's menu ends with `is empty` / `has any value`, separated by
a divider — this unlocks the "missing metadata" predicate (catalog #9)
without cluttering the natural-language list.

                         has any value           is empty
                                                 has any value

resource-ref             multi-resource-ref
─────────────────        ─────────────────
is                       includes
is not                   does not include
is any of                includes all of
is none of               includes any of
─────                    includes none of
is empty                 ─────
has any value            is empty
                         has any value
```

Two consistent rules:

- **Use words, not symbols.** `is less than 500` not `< 500`. Queries
  are read far more often than written.
- **`in the last` is critical for dates.** Writers think in "this week"
  and "last 30 days" more than absolute dates. The value input is a
  small inline `[ N ] [ days / weeks / months ]` pair.

### Intrinsic fields — merged in at query time

These aren't in `metadataSchema` but they are queryable. Map each to
the existing type's operator vocabulary:

| Intrinsic | Type | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| `type`      | `select` (closed: text/image/audio/folder) | The actual resource type |
| `folderId`  | `resource-ref` (target = folder)  | Path/parent predicate |
| `wordCount` | `number` | TextResource only |
| `createdAt` | `date`   | ISO string |
| `updatedAt` | `date`   | ISO string |
| `statuses`  | `multiselect` (options = `config.statuses`) | Resource-level status array |
| `tags`      | `multi-resource-ref` (target = tag, synthetic) | Backed by `config.tagAssignments` |
| `linkedFrom`| `multi-resource-ref` (target = resource) | From the backlink index |
| `linksTo`   | `multi-resource-ref` (target = resource) | From the backlink index |

`tags`, `linkedFrom`, and `linksTo` are *synthetic* — their data lives
outside `metadataSchema` but they present as field types the chip UI
already knows how to render.

### Value pickers, by type

Reuse the existing controls in `components/Sidebar/controls/` wherever
possible. They already handle each `MetadataFieldType` correctly with
typed input semantics.

- **text**: text input (`Input`)
- **number**: numeric input + steppers (`NumberInput`); `between`
  shows two inputs side by side
- **date**: date picker (`DateTimeInput`) for absolute operators;
  `[N] [days/weeks/months]` pair for `in the last`
- **boolean**: no value input (operator carries it)
- **select**: dropdown (`SelectInput`); multi-select for `is any of`.
  For the `status` field, pull options from `config.statuses` (matching
  existing sidebar behaviour for the locked `status` field)
- **multiselect**: chip strip with options from `field.options`
- **resource-ref**: typeahead with hover preview of the target resource.
  Use `ResourceRefInput` as the basis; extend with hover-preview
  affordance. Respect `field.refFolder` + `field.includeSubfolders`
  for candidate scoping
- **multi-resource-ref**: same as resource-ref but multi-select,
  respecting `field.maxSelections` if set. Use `MultiResourceRefInput`
  as the basis

The ref hover-preview is the chip-UI differentiator over plain
`ResourceRefInput`. It's a new affordance — the existing controls
don't have it because the sidebar doesn't need it.

No inline creation of refs. If the target isn't in the list, the user
has a data problem to solve elsewhere.

### Mid-chip mutations

When the user changes part of a chip after committing:

- **Operator change, type-compatible** (e.g. `is` → `is any of`):
  preserve the value, promote single to list.
- **Operator change, type-incompatible** (e.g. `is` → `is empty`):
  hide the value input but retain it internally so flipping back
  restores it.
- **Field change**: reset operator and value. Don't try to coerce.

These rules prevent the chip builder from silently throwing away the
user's work as they iterate.

### Validation

- **Invalid value** (bad regex, malformed date, ref with `id: null`
  meaning target was deleted): chip shows inline error state. Rest of
  the query still runs.
- **Ambiguous typeahead** (`Mara` matches both Marabel and Marabella):
  disambiguation popover, no auto-pick.
- **Out-of-domain select value** (option removed from `field.options`):
  shown as `<unknown value>` muted; click to fix.

### Deliberately excluded

- **Joins across refs** (e.g. `pov.tags includes "antagonist"`). Joins
  in filter UIs explode the surface area. Users who want this should
  build a saved query.
- **Arithmetic in chips** (e.g. `wordCount - wordCountGoal < 0`).
  Project-level `wordCountGoal` is global today; per-resource word
  goals would need a new field on the schema.
- **Regex on non-text fields.** Power users can drop to text/AST mode.

### Keyboard / power-user behavior

- `Tab`: cycle field → operator → value.
- `Enter`: commit chip and create the next one.
- `⌘D`: duplicate focused chip.
- `⌘C`: copy chip as text (the same syntax the text/AST mode uses);
  paste parses it back.
