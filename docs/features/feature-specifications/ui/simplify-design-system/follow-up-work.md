# Follow-up Work

## Task 9 — Active tag color (default, no custom color)

**Completed:** 2026-05-19

**What changed:** Migrating `TagsSection` to `<Chip>` dropped the red (`gw-red`) fill for default-color active tags. Previously, `metadata-sidebar-tag--active` used `background-color: var(--color-gw-red)`. The canonical `chip--active` state uses `gw-chrome3` (neutral highlight), consistent with the SearchFilterPanel chips.

**Why deferred:** The `chip--active` CSS rule defines a single active style. Adding a separate "canonical indicator" active variant to the generic Chip primitive would tie the primitive too tightly to one domain concept. The audit note says red fill was likely a design-system inconsistency (the theme comment says canonical indicators use red *border/text*, never fill).

**Recommendation:** If UX review decides active (assigned) tags should be visually distinct from filter-active chips, introduce a `variant: "tag"` prop to Chip with a dedicated `chip--tag-active` CSS class (using `border-gw-red-border` + `text-gw-red` rather than filled red, to align with the theme's canonical-state pattern). This is a narrow, reversible change that doesn't require touching the call sites again — just the CSS and Chip prop.

## Task 10 — Hardcoded hex check script

**Completed:** 2026-05-19

**What was done:** All 13 hardcoded hex values in `Toaster.tsx` replaced with `var(--color-gw-toast-*)` tokens. `TimelineTooltip.tsx`'s two `#D44040` uses replaced with `var(--color-gw-red-border)` / `var(--color-gw-red)`. The error toast now uses amber (`gw-saving`) instead of red, complying with FR 6.

**Remaining exempt hex:** `"#fff"` in `Chip.tsx` for white contrast text on user-chosen colored active chips — explicitly noted in audit baseline as pragmatic.

**Optional follow-up:** Codify the no-hardcoded-hex invariant as `scripts/check-no-hardcoded-hex.mjs` (analogous to `check-test-policy.mjs`) to catch regressions. The exemption list would be: `var(--color-gw-X, #FALLBACK)` CSS-var fallbacks, `#000000` color-picker placeholders, and the `"#fff"` user-color contrast case in Chip.
