# Tags

GetWrite supports project-scoped tags that can be assigned to any resource. Tags and their assignments are persisted in `project.json` under `config`.

---

## Data Model

Tags are stored in `project.json`:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "tags": [
      { "id": "uuid-a", "name": "POV Scene", "color": "#D44040" },
      { "id": "uuid-b", "name": "Key Event" }
    ],
    "tagAssignments": {
      "resource-uuid-1": ["uuid-a"],
      "resource-uuid-2": ["uuid-a", "uuid-b"]
    }
  }
}
```

**`config.tags`** — Array of tag objects:
- `id` (UUID): stable identifier for the tag
- `name` (string): display label
- `color` (string, optional): hex color for the tag chip

**`config.tagAssignments`** — Map of resource UUID → array of tag UUIDs assigned to that resource.

---

## Implementation (`tags.ts`)

`frontend/src/lib/models/tags.ts` provides CRUD operations for tags and assignments:

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Create tag | Generates a UUID, appends to `config.tags`, writes `project.json` |
| Rename tag | Finds tag by ID, updates `name`, writes `project.json` |
| Delete tag | Removes from `config.tags` and all entries in `config.tagAssignments` |
| Assign tag to resource | Adds tag UUID to `config.tagAssignments[resourceId]` |
| Remove tag from resource | Removes tag UUID from `config.tagAssignments[resourceId]` |
| List tags for resource | Reads `config.tagAssignments[resourceId]` and resolves tag objects |

All operations read the current `project.json`, apply the change, and write back atomically.

---

## Persistence

Tags are part of `project.json` — they are project-scoped and not per-resource. This means:

- Tags exist independently of resources; a tag can exist without being assigned to anything
- Tag UUIDs in `tagAssignments` must match UUIDs in `config.tags` — orphaned assignment UUIDs are ignored at read time
- The UI manages consistency; direct edits to `project.json` should maintain this constraint

---

## UI Integration

Tags are managed through the Tags section of the Metadata sidebar when a resource is selected. The app reads `config.tags` to populate available options and writes `config.tagAssignments` when the user assigns or removes a tag.

Project-level tag management (create, rename, delete) is accessible from the project settings UI.
