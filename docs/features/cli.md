# GetWrite CLI

The GetWrite CLI (`getwrite-cli`) is a Node.js command-line tool for project management, Scrivener import, template operations, revision pruning, integrity checks, screenshot capture, and a developer-facing agentic QA harness.

It lives in its own pnpm workspace package, **`cli/`**, separate from the Next.js frontend. It consumes the framework-free model layer through the single `@gw/core` barrel (`frontend/src/lib/core.ts`), which esbuild bundles at build time. See [ADR-016](../architecture/ADRs/adr-016-cli-extraction-and-deferred-core-package.md) for the rationale and the deferred follow-up (promoting `@gw/core` to a standalone package).

---

## Building the CLI

From the repo root:

```sh
pnpm cli:build          # or: pnpm --filter getwrite-cli build
```

(`pnpm build` / `next build` does **not** produce the CLI.)

The bundled CLI is written to:

```
cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs
```

---

## Invocation

```sh
node ./cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs <command> [args]
```

During development you can also run the CLI's tests against the command modules directly (the CLI is tested with `GETWRITE_CLI_TESTING=1` to suppress `process.exit`):

```sh
pnpm cli:test           # or: pnpm --filter getwrite-cli test
```

---

## Commands

### `project create`

Creates a new GetWrite project on disk from a project-type spec file.

```sh
getwrite-cli project create [projectRoot] --spec <specPath> [--name <name>]
```

**Arguments:**

- `projectRoot` (optional) — directory to create the project in. Defaults to `.` (current directory).

**Options:**

- `-s, --spec <specPath>` (required) — path to a project-type JSON spec file. See `getwrite-config/templates/project-types/` for bundled specs.
- `-n, --name <name>` (optional) — display name for the project. Defaults to the spec's `name` field.

**What it does:**

1. Validates the spec file.
2. Creates `<projectRoot>/project.json`.
3. Creates `<projectRoot>/folders/<slug>/folder.json` for each folder in the spec.
4. Creates `<projectRoot>/resources/<uuid>/content.txt` and `content.tiptap.json` for each default resource.
5. Creates `<projectRoot>/meta/resource-<uuid>.meta.json` sidecars.
6. Creates `<projectRoot>/revisions/<uuid>/v-1/` initial revisions (canonical).

**Exit codes:** `0` = success, `2` = error

**Example:**

```sh
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs project create ./my-novel \
  --spec getwrite-config/templates/project-types/novel_project_type.json \
  --name "My Novel"
```

---

### `project import-scrivener`

Imports a Scrivener 3, Mac-authored `.scriv` project into a new, complete GetWrite project (Feature 31). One-shot, CLI-only, never writes to the source project.

```sh
getwrite-cli project import-scrivener <scrivPath> [projectRoot] [--name <name>]
```

**Arguments:**

- `scrivPath` (required) — path to the source `.scriv` package directory (not the `.scrivx` file itself).
- `projectRoot` (optional) — directory to create the destination project in. Defaults to `.` (current directory).

**Options:**

- `-n, --name <name>` (optional) — destination project name. Defaults to `scrivPath`'s basename with the `.scriv` extension stripped.

**Refusal check:** before writing anything, the command inspects the source `.scrivx` file's root `Creator` attribute. Only a `Creator` starting with `SCRMAC-3` (Scrivener 3, Mac-authored) is accepted — this is an allow-list, so a Windows-authored project, a Scrivener 2 project, or any unrecognized `Creator` format is refused with a clear message and a non-zero exit, with nothing written to the destination. A `projectRoot` that already exists and is non-empty is refused the same way, before any write; if `projectRoot` did not exist before the run, a fatal error partway through the write phase deletes it again on the way out.

**What it carries over:**

1. The Draft binder's folder/document hierarchy and text (at the destination project's root), plus the Research folder's text content and every other top-level user folder, each as its own top-level GetWrite folder. A binder item with no `<Title>` is imported under a generated fallback name ("Untitled", "Untitled 2", ...), reported.
2. Each document's `content.rtf`, converted to `content.txt` + `content.tiptap.json` (bold/italic preserved as TipTap marks; `\line` as a hard break; backslash-newline treated as a paragraph break alongside `\par`; `\'XX` hex escapes decoded via the document's declared `\ansicpg` code page; a `\field`/`HYPERLINK` run converts to plain text).
3. Each document's synopsis/notes (into sidecar `userMetadata.synopsis`/`userMetadata.notes`, enabling the corresponding feature toggles), Status (seeding `config.statuses` and `userMetadata.status`), Label (a new "Label" select metadata field), Keywords (as GetWrite tags, merging keywords that share a leaf name), and CustomMetaData fields (as new per-project metadata-schema fields). A field whose derived key collides with a built-in or already-added field is created under a suffixed key instead (e.g. `pov-scrivener`), keeping its Scrivener title as the label; the rename is reported.
4. Rebuilds the destination project's inverted index, backlinks, and entity mention index from scratch (mirroring `reindex`); background indexing and the backlinks watcher are suspended for the whole write phase so this rebuild is the only indexing work the run performs.

**What it skips or defers, and reports:** an RTF feature with no GetWrite equivalent, an unreadable/malformed `content.rtf` fragment, a malformed `.scrivx` fragment (recovered as a skip rather than aborting the import), or a custom-metadata field type with no GetWrite mapping (each skipped individually, without aborting the run); the project's Trash content; non-text Research content (media, PDFs, web archives); and any `Type="Other"` binder item, wherever it occurs. On completion the command writes `<projectRoot>/scrivener-import-report.txt`, a fixed eight-section report (Skipped Items, Field Key Renames, Keyword Merges, Unconverted Research Content, Excluded "Other" Items, Trash Content, Snapshot History, Untitled Fallback Names) — every section always appears, even when empty.

**Exit codes:** `0` = success, `2` = refused source project (unsupported Creator or non-empty destination) or unexpected error

**Example:**

```sh
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs project import-scrivener ./MyNovel.scriv ./my-novel
# Imported Scrivener project to: ./my-novel
# Folders: 4, Resources: 12, Tags: 6
# Report written to: ./my-novel/scrivener-import-report.txt
```

---

### `templates save`

Saves a new empty template to the project's template directory.

```sh
getwrite-cli templates save <projectRoot> <templateId> <name>
```

Writes an empty text template to `<projectRoot>/meta/templates/<templateId>.json`:

```json
{ "id": "<templateId>", "name": "<name>", "type": "text", "plainText": "" }
```

**Example:**

```sh
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs templates save ./my-novel scene "Scene"
```

---

### `templates create`

Creates a new resource from an existing template.

```sh
getwrite-cli templates create <projectRoot> <templateId> [name]
```

Loads `<projectRoot>/meta/templates/<templateId>.json` and instantiates a new resource from it, optionally overriding the display name. Prints the new resource's UUID on success.

**Example:**

```sh
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs templates create ./my-novel scene "Opening Scene"
# Created resource b19abcd4-81b2-44ef-b4b4-ba1310dbdf87
```

---

### `templates duplicate`

Duplicates an existing resource as a new resource within the same project.

```sh
getwrite-cli templates duplicate <projectRoot> <resourceId>
```

Copies the resource's content and sidecar to a new UUID. Prints the new resource ID:

```
Duplicated resource -> <newId>
```

**Example:**

```sh
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs templates duplicate ./my-novel b19abcd4-81b2-44ef-b4b4-ba1310dbdf87
```

---

### `templates list`

Lists all templates stored in a project.

```sh
getwrite-cli templates list <projectRoot>
```

Reads all `.json` files from `<projectRoot>/meta/templates/` and prints one tab-separated line per template: `<id>\t<name>\t<type>`.

**Example:**

```sh
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs templates list ./my-novel
# scene    Scene    text
# chapter  Chapter  text
```

---

### `prune`

Removes old revision snapshots to enforce a maximum retained revisions count per resource.

```sh
getwrite-cli prune [projectRoot] [--max <number>]
```

**Arguments:**

- `projectRoot` (optional) — project to prune. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.

**Options:**

- `-m, --max <number>` (optional) — maximum revisions to keep per resource. Defaults to `50`.

**What it does:**

1. Reads all resource UUIDs from `<projectRoot>/resources/`.
2. For each resource, calls `pruneRevisions(projectRoot, resourceId, maxRevisions)`.
3. Deletes selected revision directories (`revisions/<resourceId>/v-<N>/`).
4. Canonical and preserved (`metadata.preserve: true`) revisions are never pruned.

**Exit codes:** `0` = success, `2` = unexpected error

**Examples:**

```sh
# Prune current directory project, keeping 50 revisions (default)
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs prune

# Prune a specific project, keeping only the 10 most recent revisions
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs prune /path/to/my-project --max 10
```

---

### `reindex`

Rebuilds the inverted index, backlinks, and entity mention index for a project from scratch by re-scanning all resources. Use after bulk filesystem changes that bypassed the normal save path, or to recover from a corrupted/stale index.

```sh
getwrite-cli reindex [projectRoot]
```

**Arguments:**

- `projectRoot` (optional) — project to reindex. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.

**What it does:**

1. Reads all resource UUIDs from `<projectRoot>/resources/`.
2. For each resource, loads its content and re-indexes it into `meta/index/inverted.json`.
3. Recomputes backlinks across all resources and persists `meta/backlinks.json`.
4. Rebuilds the entity mention index from scratch (declared entities detected by name/alias in every resource's prose) and persists `meta/index/mentions.json`.

**Exit codes:** `0` = success, `2` = unexpected error

**Example:**

```sh
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs reindex ./my-novel
# [reindex] Done — indexed 12 resource(s) in ./my-novel
```

**One-time note for existing projects:** A backlinks fix now makes
`resource-ref`/`multi-resource-ref` fields resolve correctly, including ones
nested under user-defined metadata fields — previously these were silently
skipped when computing backlinks. For a project you keep working in, no
action is needed: saving any resource recomputes and persists
`meta/backlinks.json` for the whole project, so the on-disk index self-heals
the next time you save. For a project you don't plan to edit again, run
`getwrite-cli reindex` once to bring its backlinks up to date immediately.
Note the limitation this leaves: a project that is never edited again and is
never manually reindexed keeps a stale backlink index indefinitely, and
there is no in-app signal that this is the case.

---

### `doctor`

Read-only integrity check for a project on disk. It flags **broken folder associations** — resources (and folders) whose parent folder id no longer resolves to any existing folder descriptor. These are the orphans the resource tree silently re-parents to the root, the failure mode behind a "lost" folder whose children resurface at the top level.

```sh
getwrite-cli doctor [projectRoot]
```

**Arguments:**

- `projectRoot` (optional) — project to check. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.

**What it does:**

1. Collects every folder id from `<projectRoot>/folders/**/folder.json`.
2. Flags each resource sidecar whose `folderId` is set but matches no folder.
3. Flags each folder whose parent (`parentId`/`folderId`) matches no folder.

**Exit codes:** `0` = no problems, `1` = one or more problems found, `2` = unexpected error. (The non-zero exit on findings makes it usable as a CI/pre-commit gate.)

**Example:**

```sh
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs doctor ./my-novel
# [doctor] Found 6 problem(s) in ./my-novel:
#   - orphaned resource: "Episode 1 - Scene 1" (3d2604fb-…) -> missing folder 09326c57-…
#   ...
```

To repair, recreate the missing folder reusing its id (so the existing `folderId` references resolve) or move the orphaned items into an existing folder.

---

### `screenshots capture`

Captures full-page screenshots of Storybook stories via a headless Chromium browser (Playwright). Useful for visual regression baselining, design reviews, and CI artifacts.

```sh
getwrite-cli screenshots capture [options]
```

**Options:**

- `-b, --storybook <url>` (default `http://localhost:6006`) — base URL of a running Storybook instance.
- `-o, --out <dir>` (default `./screenshots`) — directory to write PNG files into.
- `-l, --limit <n>` (default `6`) — maximum number of stories to capture.

It fetches Storybook's `/index.json` manifest to discover story IDs, navigates to each story's iframe URL, and saves a full-page PNG. Output files are named from the story ID with `:` and `/` replaced by `_` (e.g. `components-button--primary.png`).

**Exit codes:** `1` = no stories found in `index.json`, `2` = unexpected capture error

**Example:**

```sh
# Capture up to 20 stories from a remote Storybook, saving to /tmp/shots
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs screenshots capture \
  --storybook https://storybook.example.com --out /tmp/shots --limit 20
```

### `qa`

Developer-facing agentic QA harness (MVP, on-demand, not wired into CI). An
agent — a Claude Code session driving the Playwright MCP server declared in
`.mcp.json` — drives the real GetWrite web app against a disposable, out-of-tree
workspace, and every UI-reported success is independently confirmed against
the filesystem. Inventory scope is limited to projects, resources, and
revisions; see `specs/features/agentic-qa.md` for the full spec and
`specs/features/agentic-qa/procedure.md` for the agent's operating procedure.

Each sub-command below is a separate process invocation; state (workspace
path, server port/pid, accumulated outcomes) is persisted between them to
`<os.tmpdir()>/getwrite-qa/session.json`.

```sh
getwrite-cli qa start
getwrite-cli qa verify project-manifest <projectId>
getwrite-cli qa verify resource-content <projectId> <resourceId> --expected-text "hello"
getwrite-cli qa record unreachable --item-id <id> --reason "control not present"
getwrite-cli qa report
getwrite-cli qa finish
```

**`qa start`** — Creates a fresh disposable workspace via `fs.mkdtemp` outside
the repo tree, starts a Next.js dev server against it (`GETWRITE_PROJECTS_DIR`
pre-set, bound to a free port, URL reported as `http://localhost:<port>`, not
`127.0.0.1` — see note below), and writes the session record.

**`qa verify <kind> [args...]`** — Checks on-disk state for one inventory item
and records the outcome. `kind` is one of `project-manifest`,
`resource-content`, `resource-sidecar`, `revision`. Options: `--expected
<json>` (project-manifest, resource-sidecar), `--expected-text <text>`
(resource-content), `--min-count <n>` (revision), `--item-id <id>`,
`--description <text>`, `--ui-outcome <text>`.

**`qa record <status>`** — Records an outcome with no filesystem check, for
when the agent could not reach a control at all. `status` is one of
`unreachable`, `unverified`, `fail` — `pass` is deliberately not recordable
here; it must be earned via `qa verify`. `--item-id <id>` is required;
`--reason <text>` is required for `unreachable`.

**`qa report`** — Writes `specs/features/agentic-qa/run-report.md`, reconciled
against `specs/features/agentic-qa/inventory.md` so an inventory item the run
never recorded an outcome for is listed as unverified rather than silently
omitted.

**`qa finish`** — Stops the dev server (confirmed by PID, not assumed),
deletes the workspace only if every exercised item passed, and removes the
session record. Any failure or unverified item retains the workspace for
diagnosis.

Two non-obvious behaviors baked into the harness:

- The server URL must use `localhost`, not `127.0.0.1` — Next 16 treats a
  bare IP as a foreign origin absent `allowedDevOrigins` and refuses the HMR
  socket and client chunks, so the page returns 200 but React never hydrates.
- The dev server's stdio is redirected to a log file inside the workspace
  (`qa-server.log`), never a pipe — `qa start`'s process exits immediately,
  and an unread pipe buffer would deadlock the server after one request.

**Example:**

```sh
node cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs qa start
# [qa start] Workspace: /var/folders/.../getwrite-qa-xxxxxx
# [qa start] Server URL: http://localhost:54213
```
