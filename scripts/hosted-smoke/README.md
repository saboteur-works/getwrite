# Hosted-auth live smoke (auth-provider plan, Task 8)

The automated gate (`pnpm test:ci`) mocks better-auth and PostgreSQL by design,
so it proves the code compiles and its units behave — but never that the hosted
authentication path works end to end against real infrastructure. This directory
is that missing test: real Postgres, a real SMTP sink, a real production build of
the app, driven through the full account lifecycle.

It exists because Slice 5 (ADR-019) shipped an object-store backend that passed
its entire conformance suite while the app was still broken on that backend; only
a live smoke caught it. Auth has a worse failure mode — credential compromise or
cross-tenant data exposure — so it gets the same treatment before real-credential
go-live (which is separately gated on the FR26 independent security review).

## What it checks

`smoke.mjs` drives, against a running server:

- **Signup gating (FR12/FR15)** — a non-allowlisted address is rejected, and the
  rejection does not disclose the gating.
- **Verification + login (FR11/FR13/FR14)** — allowlisted signup → verification
  email arrives over SMTP → login is refused until the mailed link is consumed →
  login succeeds after.
- **Anti-enumeration (FR15)** — a duplicate signup returns a generic success, not
  a distinguishable "already exists" error.
- **Tenant isolation (ADR-017/018)** — user A creates a project; it lands on disk
  under `GETWRITE_DATA_ROOT/<A-uuid>/`; user B sees none of it; the minted user id
  satisfies the `^[a-z0-9_-]{1,64}$` tenant-path allowlist.
- **Route enforcement (FR9/FR18/FR20)** — anonymous tenant request → 401;
  cross-origin and origin-less mutations → 403 (CSRF, fail-closed); anonymous page
  request → redirect to `/login`; authenticated page request → 200.
- **Rate limiting (FR16)** — repeated failed logins from one IP get a 429.
- **Revocation (FR17)** — see **Findings** below.

Informational probes (never pass/fail, printed as `NOTE`) record two real
behaviors worth the security reviewer's attention: multi-hop `x-forwarded-for`
handling, and that the CSRF origin comparison ignores port.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (Compose v2). `docker compose version` should work.
- The frontend built for production: `pnpm --filter getwrite-frontend build`.
- The pinned `@better-auth/cli` devDependency (already in `frontend`).

## Run book

All commands from the repo root unless noted.

```bash
# 1. Bring up Postgres (host :55432) and Mailpit (SMTP :51025, UI :58025).
docker compose -f scripts/hosted-smoke/compose.yml up -d

# 2. Create the auth schema in that Postgres. Uses the CLI-only config
#    (frontend/better-auth.config.ts) — auth-server.ts can't be used by the CLI
#    (lazy export + server-only guard). This emits user/account/session/
#    verification AND the rateLimit table (the config declares database storage).
cd frontend
DATABASE_URL='postgres://getwrite:getwrite@localhost:55432/getwrite_auth' \
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET='smoke-secret-not-for-production-0123456789' \
BETTER_AUTH_URL='http://localhost:3000' \
  pnpm exec better-auth migrate --config better-auth.config.ts -y

# 3. Start the app with the hosted-auth env. GETWRITE_DATA_ROOT is a throwaway
#    tenant root the smoke inspects directly for on-disk isolation.
DATABASE_URL='postgres://getwrite:getwrite@localhost:55432/getwrite_auth' \
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET='smoke-secret-not-for-production-0123456789' \
BETTER_AUTH_URL='http://localhost:3000' \
SMTP_HOST=localhost SMTP_PORT=51025 SMTP_USER=smoke SMTP_PASS=smoke \
SMTP_FROM=noreply@getwrite.test \
AUTH_SIGNUP_ALLOWLIST='@allowed.test' \
GETWRITE_DATA_ROOT="$(mktemp -d)" \
  node .next/standalone/frontend/server.js &
#    (`pnpm start` also works but warns under output:standalone; the standalone
#     server.js is the deployment artifact and the more faithful target.)

# 4. Drive the smoke (from the repo root), pointing it at the SAME data root.
GETWRITE_DATA_ROOT='<the mktemp dir from step 3>' \
ALLOWED_DOMAIN=allowed.test \
  node scripts/hosted-smoke/smoke.mjs

# 5. Tear down (throws the database away — ephemeral by design).
docker compose -f scripts/hosted-smoke/compose.yml down
```

Mailpit's web UI at <http://localhost:58025> shows every captured message if you
want to eyeball the verification/reset mail.

The smoke exits `0` only when every hard check passes. The one check currently
expected to fail is the FR17 cookie-cache finding below; treat a **new** failure
elsewhere as a real regression.

## Findings

### FR17 — "log out everywhere" is delayed by the session cookie cache

**Status: open, decision-pending. Hand to the FR26 security review.**

`revokeSessions()` deletes the user's session rows in Postgres, and the smoke
confirms that a session token with the cache cookie stripped is immediately dead
(401). But `auth-server.ts` sets `session.cookieCache: { enabled: true }`, which
makes better-auth serve a **signed session snapshot from the `better-auth.session_data`
cookie for its `maxAge` (default 5 minutes) without consulting the database**.
`betterAuthIdentitySource` calls `getSession()` on every tenant request, so any
session with a warm cache cookie — including the **other** device "log out
everywhere" is meant to kill — keeps full authenticated access to tenant data for
up to 5 minutes after revocation.

The cache was enabled citing FR17 (avoid a per-request Postgres round-trip), yet
it undermines FR17's revocation guarantee. Options, for the reviewer to weigh:

1. **Shorten `cookieCache.maxAge`** to a few seconds — bounds the residual-access
   window while keeping most of the per-request DB savings. Likely the best
   balance; recommended default.
2. **Disable `cookieCache`** — every tenant request does a DB session lookup;
   revocation is immediate, at a per-request Postgres cost.
3. **Accept the window** and document it as a known revocation latency — only
   defensible if the threat model tolerates a multi-minute window on "log out
   everywhere," which for a stolen-session action it usually does not.

Whichever is chosen, flip the smoke's final revocation check to a hard gate once
the window is closed.
