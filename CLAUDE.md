# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**GetWrite** is a local-first, file-system backed writing workspace. There is no database—projects, resources, and metadata persist as JSON files and directory structures under `/projects` at the repo root. The stack is Next.js (App Router), React 19, Redux Toolkit, TipTap editor, and Zod for validation. It ships both as a hosted Next.js app and as a desktop Electron app that bundles the Next.js standalone server.

## Workspace Layout

This is a pnpm workspace (pnpm@10.28.0, pinned). `pnpm-workspace.yaml` lists four packages:

- `frontend/` — `getwrite-frontend`. The Next.js app, Redux store, Zod models, Storybook, and all UI tests.
- `electron/` — `getwrite-electron`. Desktop shell that spawns the Next.js standalone server and opens a `BrowserWindow`.
- `cli/` — `getwrite-cli`. Standalone CLI tools bundled separately with esbuild.
- `android/` — `getwrite-android`. Capacitor Android sibling shell (ADR-021; Phase 2 wires the real app into the WebView via `frontend`'s `pnpm build:native`); `pnpm --filter getwrite-android build` is still a scaffold placeholder, not a real Gradle build.

Additional repo-root directories that are **not** workspace packages but are referenced at runtime:

- `projects/` — On-disk project store (one folder per project; UUID-named).
- `getwrite-config/templates/project-types/` — JSON specs for the built-in project types (`article`, `blank`, `game_documentation`, `novel`, `poetry_and_lyrics`, `serial`) plus `project-type.schema.json`.
- `specs/` — Specification artifacts; per the authority hierarchy, specs win conflicts. `specs/product/` holds the product-level ladder — `getwrite.md` (product spec) and `getwrite.features.md` (feature list), both relocated from `docs/` on 2026-08-24 and conformant to their pipeline schemas (`sab.product-spec/1`, `sab.features/1`). `specs/features/` holds per-feature specs. `001-…` through `005-…` are the earlier numbered specs that drove larger work.
- `docs/standards/` — Coding/testing standards (see below).
- `scripts/` — Repo-level scripts (currently `showcase`).
- `electron/electron-builder.yml` — Packaging config for the desktop build.

Repo-root scripts (run from the repo root):

```bash
pnpm start            # alias for: pnpm --filter getwrite-frontend dev
pnpm electron:dev     # tsc + electron dist/main.js (electron workspace)
pnpm electron:build   # build frontend + electron
pnpm electron:package # electron-builder
pnpm storybook        # frontend storybook
pnpm knip             # dead-code / unused export check
```

**Next.js DevTools MCP**: when a task involves running, debugging, or modifying the Next.js app itself (dev server, App Router routing, server components, build config, caching), call the `init` tool from `next-devtools` first. Skip it for tasks that only touch unrelated files (CLI, models, Electron, docs).

## Development Commands

Run from `frontend/` unless noted. Node version managed by Volta.

```bash
pnpm dev        # Dev server
pnpm typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint       # ESLint
pnpm build      # next build
pnpm test       # Vitest (watch)
pnpm test:ci    # Vitest (single pass)
pnpm test:e2e   # Playwright — requires pnpm storybook on :6006
```

From the repo root: `pnpm --filter getwrite-frontend exec vitest` runs frontend tests via the workspace.

### Running git from outside the repo

Claude Code's command sandbox allows writes only under the session's working
directory. If the session's cwd is _not_ this repo, writes into `.git/` are denied:

```
$ touch /path/to/getwrite/.git/probe
touch: ... Operation not permitted
```

This splits git commands into two cases:

- **Read-only (`git log`, `git diff`, `git show`, `git status`) — works from anywhere.**
  These only _opportunistically_ refresh `.git/index`; git tolerates that write failing
  and still prints correct output. Use `git -C /path/to/getwrite …` rather than `cd`.
- **Mutating (`git commit`, `git checkout`, `git merge`, `git rebase`) — needs cwd inside
  the repo.** These genuinely must write to `.git/`, so they fail rather than degrade.
  `-C` is not a workaround; start the session in the repo.

**Do not disable the sandbox to run read-only git.** `git log --oneline main..HEAD` and
`git diff --stat main..HEAD` both succeed sandboxed — a `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`
prompt on those is a preemptive guess, not a real denial, and escaping buys nothing.

## Architecture

### Data Layer (No Database)

- **Storage**: `projects/` at the repo root contains one UUID-named folder per project. Each project directory contains:
  - `project.json` — top-level project manifest
  - `resources/<uuid>/` — one folder per text resource with `content.txt` + `content.tiptap.json`
  - `folders/` — folder-tree state for the resource tree
  - `meta/resource-<uuid>.meta.json` — per-resource sidecar metadata
  - `meta/index/` — materialized indexes (inverted index, backlinks, field values, entity mentions)
  - `meta/queries/` — saved queries used by smart folders
  - `meta/templates/` — resource template scaffolds
  - `revisions/<uuid>/v-<N>/` — versioned snapshots per resource
  - `.trash/{resources,meta}/` — soft-deleted content (see [Glossary: Trash](#glossary))
- **API routes** (`frontend/app/api/`): Read/write the filesystem directly. Top-level groups: `projects`, `project/*` (id, delete, rename, tags, preferences, editor-config, metadata-schema, revision-settings, query, features), `project-resources`, `project-types`, `resource/*` (id, revision, upload, mentions, mentioned-in), `compile`, `export`, `version-check` (Electron update check), `encryption` (lock state + unlock/lock/enable/export/resume; the keyring is
  server-side on web and desktop because the model layer needs `node:fs`),
  `auth/[...all]` (better-auth catch-all — sign-up/in/out, session, verification, password reset; hosted-auth-only, 404s when inactive), `auth-status` (client-facing `isHostedAuthActive()` signal, presentational only). Project-scoped routes resolve their project root as `path.join(resolveProjectsDir(), projectId)` from a server-validated `projectId` (`frontend/src/lib/models/project-path.ts`) — they do not accept a client-supplied `projectRoot`/`projectPath`. See `docs/standards/storage-context.md`.
- **Schemas** (`frontend/src/lib/models/schemas.ts`): Zod validators gate all persisted data crossing the filesystem boundary
- **File locking**: `frontend/src/lib/models/locks.ts` is a generic per-key async mutex; `meta-locks.ts` serializes metadata-affecting operations keyed by project root

### State Management

Redux Toolkit slices mirror filesystem state into the UI:

- `projectsSlice` — active project selection and metadata
- `resourcesSlice` — resources and folder hierarchy
- `revisionsSlice` — revision/version history
- `editorConfigSlice` — per-project editor configuration
- `querySlice` — saved queries and query execution state
- `searchSlice` — cross-resource search state

State is loaded on mount via `GET /api/projects` and updated explicitly via API calls. There is no optimistic or auto-sync layer.

### Code Map

All paths relative to `frontend/src/`. Use these as orientation; open the files directly for details.

**Models (`lib/models/`)** — boundary between filesystem and the rest of the app.

- _Validation & types_: `schemas.ts`, `types.ts`
- _Projects_: `project.ts` (create/validate/normalize), `project-creator.ts`, `project-loader.ts`, `project-config.ts`, `project-features.ts` (per-project feature flags), `projects-dir.ts`, `project-path.ts` (`validateProjectId`/`respondInvalidProjectId` — UUID-validated, fail-closed guard API routes use to derive a project's on-disk directory from a client-supplied `projectId`), `project-view.ts`, `project-view-adapter.ts`
- _Resources & templates_: `resource.ts`, `resource-factory.ts`, `resource-persistence.ts`, `resource-revision.ts` (initial canonical revision), `resource-templates.ts`, `template-service.ts`, `sidecar.ts`, `trash.ts`, `folder-utils.ts`
- _Media_: `media-metadata.ts` (image/audio metadata at ingest), `media-validation.ts` (type + size-cap checks)
- _Revisions_: `revision.ts`, `revision-manager.ts`, `revision-settings.ts`, `pruneExecutor.ts`
- _Metadata & tags_: `metadata-schema.ts`, `default-metadata-schema.ts`, `tags.ts`
- _Query pipeline_: `query-ast.ts`, `query-evaluator.ts`, `query-cache.ts`, `query-intrinsics.ts`, `saved-queries.ts`
- _Index & search_: `indexer-queue.ts`, `inverted-index.ts`, `backlinks.ts`, `backlinks-watcher.ts`, `field-values.ts`, `field-value-keys.ts`, `field-dedup.ts`, `previews.ts`, `search-scoring.ts`, `search-snippet.ts`
- _Entities & mentions_: `entity-detection.ts` (word-boundary/possessive/plural alias matching, offline and pure), `entity-alias-table.ts` (per-project table of every entity's name + aliases, plus cross-entity ambiguity detection), `entity-alias-warnings.ts` (non-blocking short/common-word alias noise heuristics), `mention-index.ts` (mention index schema and persistence under `meta/index/mentions.json`, rebuilt from scratch by `indexer-queue.ts` and the `reindex` CLI), `mentions-core.ts` (transport-agnostic reads over the mention index, merging in explicit `linkedFrom` backlinks and ambiguity flags for the entity's own "mentioned in" view)
- _I/O_: `io.ts` (StorageAdapter over `fs/promises`), `memoryAdapter.ts` (in-memory adapter for tests), `object-store.ts` + `objectStoreAdapter.ts` (flat object-store backend selectable per request via `app/api/_tenant/storage-backend.ts`; ADR-019), `storage-context.ts` (`AsyncLocalStorage`-backed request/task-scoped `{ tenantRoot, adapter, projectRoot? }` — `projectRoot` names the single project a scope operates on, which is what lets `io.ts` enforce the write barrier, plus a module-scoped default fallback for the native build; see `docs/standards/storage-context.md`)
- _Update check_: `update-check.ts` (compares running version to latest GitHub release)
- _Concurrency_: `locks.ts`, `meta-locks.ts`, `write-barrier.ts` (exclusive
  project-scoped barrier held for the duration of a conversion; enforced inside
  `io.ts`'s mutating wrappers via `StorageContext.projectRoot`)
- _Encryption (ADR-022)_: `encryptingAdapter.ts` (`StorageAdapter` decorator
  sealing file bodies) and `crypto/` — `primitives.ts` (Argon2id via
  `@noble/hashes`, AES-256-GCM via `crypto.subtle`), `envelope.ts`
  (self-identifying versioned container), `keyring.ts` + `keyring-store.ts` +
  `keyring-session.ts` (workspace key, per-project data keys, session lifecycle),
  `project-marker.ts` (plaintext opt-in marker), `name-index.ts` (sealed project
  id → name index), `adapter-selection.ts` (per-project resolution),
  `workspace-adapter.ts` (per-request routing by path — the adapter actually
  bound by `with-storage-context.ts`), `convert-project.ts` (crash-safe,
  resumable, bidirectional sweep), `enable-encryption.ts` (orchestration +
  startup resume), `export-plaintext.ts` (FR24 escape hatch),
  `encryption-availability.ts` (hosted fail-closed)
- _Native (Android, ADR-021 Phase 0-2)_: `capacitor-filesystem.ts` (in-memory fake `CapacitorFilesystemLike`), `capacitor-filesystem-real.ts` (real `@capacitor/filesystem` bridge to the same contract; native-only, dynamic-import-only), `capacitorFsAdapter.ts` (`StorageAdapter` over either), `native-bootstrap.ts` (`bootstrapNativeStorageContext()` — one-time app-startup binding of the real bridge as the default `StorageContext`, invoked from the root layout's client-only `NativeBootstrap` component), `native-device-harness.ts` (manual, code-only on-device verification harness, including image/audio base64 throughput checks as of Phase 2; not wired into any UI), `project-root-resolver.ts` (`Response`-free `resolveProjectRoot()` shared by every lifted core), `revision-core.ts`, `query-evaluate-core.ts`, `saved-query-dispatch-core.ts`, `metadata-schema-dispatch-core.ts` (Phase 1 transport-agnostic cores), `project-crud-core.ts`, `project-preferences-core.ts`, `resource-crud-core.ts`, `resource-excerpts-core.ts`, `tags-crud-core.ts`, `editor-config-core.ts`, `compile-core.ts`, `export-core.ts` (Phase 2 transport-agnostic cores lifted out of `lib/api/*` and their HTTP routes) — each core is reused by an HTTP route and its `store/transport/native-*-backend.ts` counterpart. `project-types-static.ts` is the Phase 2 exception: a static-import registry of the `getwrite-config/templates/project-types/*.json` specs (via the tracked `frontend/getwrite-config` symlink) used only by the native project-types backend, since native has no `node:fs` access to read them off disk the way the HTTP route does (imported via the generated `frontend/getwrite-config` link — see below).

**Auth (`lib/auth/`)** — server-only hosted-authentication path (better-auth + PostgreSQL; opt-in, hosted-only; see [ADR-020](docs/architecture/ADRs/adr-020-hybrid-auth-postgres-better-auth.md)). `auth-config.ts` (`isHostedAuthActive()` — single source of truth for whether `DATABASE_URL` + `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` are both set), `auth-server.ts` (lazily-built, memoized `betterAuth(...)` instance), `email.ts` (`nodemailer` SMTP transport wired into verification/reset callbacks), `signup-allowlist.ts` (`AUTH_SIGNUP_ALLOWLIST` gate consulted by a `databaseHooks.user.create.before` hook, not `disableSignUp`), `session-guard.ts` (`shouldRedirectToLogin` — the decision core behind the `(app)` route-group layout's page redirect), `verify-email-core.ts` (server-side `/verify-email` token consumption). `auth-client.ts` (client-side `better-auth/react` wrapper) and `use-auth-session.ts` (`useAuthSession()` — the combined hosted-active + authenticated signal UI components read) are the client-safe counterparts in the same directory. Desktop/local never configures the hosted-auth env, so none of this runs and no Postgres connection is ever attempted (`GETWRITE_ENABLE_DEV_IDENTITY` remains the mechanism for exercising tenant resolution locally without hosted auth — see the Store's `auth-status-transport-service` note and `docs/standards/storage-context.md`).

**Store (`store/`)** — Redux Toolkit. Pattern per feature: `<feature>Slice.ts` + `*-transport-service.ts` (HTTP) + `*-guards.ts` (invariants).

- _Slices_: `projectsSlice`, `resourcesSlice`, `revisionsSlice`, `editorConfigSlice`, `querySlice`, `searchSlice`, `cryptoSlice` (workspace lock state only — never key material; see ADR-022), `entityAliasTableSlice` (client-side cache of the active project's `EntityAliasTable`, refetched on project load, resource load, and a resolved sidecar save — not pushed on any server-side signal)
- _Transports_: `revision-transport-service`, `query-transport-service`, `search-transport-service`, `metadata-schema-transport-service`, `feature-config-transport-service` (per-project feature flags), `update-check-transport-service` (Electron update notice), `auth-status-transport-service` (fetches `GET /api/auth-status`; fail-safe `{ hostedAuthActive: false }` on any error). As of ADR-021 Phase 1, all seven resolve HTTP-vs-native through the generalized `store/transport/create-transport.ts` (`createTransport<T>(httpImpl, loadNative)`), the sole transport-collapse mechanism — search was refactored onto it alongside four newly core-lifted services (revision, query, metadata-schema, feature-config), each with its own `store/transport/native-<service>-backend.ts` (+ `.web-stub.ts`) in-process native implementation; auth-status and update-check wire through it too, with trivial hardcoded native short-circuits and no core-lift. **ADR-021 Phase 2** extends the same `createTransport` collapse past `store/` and onto `src/lib/api/*` — the nine client-facing modules (`projects`, `resources`, `resource-excerpts`, `tags`, `preferences`, `editor-config`, `project-types`, `compile`, `export`) and `project-actions-controller.ts` now each resolve HTTP-vs-native the same way, backed by their own `native-*-backend.ts` (+ `.web-stub.ts`) pair. So on native, every client→server call in the app — not just the seven `store/`-level transports — collapses in-process; there is no longer any HTTP round-trip on the native path. The entity layer's `lib/api/mentions.ts` (added after Phase 2) follows the same collapse for ADR-021 parity, backed by `store/transport/native-mentions-backend.ts` (+ `.web-stub.ts`) over the shared `mentions-core.ts`. `lib/api/entity-alias-table.ts` (added for entity highlighting) follows the same pattern again, backed by `store/transport/native-entity-alias-table-backend.ts` (+ `.web-stub.ts`).
- _Guards & normalizers_: `revision-canonical-guards` (single-canonical invariant), `queries-guards`, `revision-normalization`
- _Controllers_: `project-actions-controller` (multi-step project ops)
- _Plumbing_: `store.ts`, `ClientProvider.tsx`, `hooks.ts` (typed `useAppDispatch`/`useAppSelector`)

### Electron Shell (`electron/`)

- Entry: `electron/src/main.ts` + `electron/src/preload.ts`; compiled to `electron/dist/` via `tsc`.
- On launch, resolves repo root (or `process.resourcesPath` when packaged) and spawns the frontend's Next.js **standalone** server (`frontend/.next/standalone`) as a child process on port 3000, then opens a `BrowserWindow` pointed at it.
- Injects `GETWRITE_PROJECTS_DIR` into the spawned server's environment, which `frontend/src/lib/models/projects-dir.ts` honors — this is how the desktop build can store projects somewhere other than `cwd/../projects`.
- `electron/src/projects-dir.ts` decides that location and is unit-tested (`electron/tests/`, run in CI by `.github/workflows/electron-checks.yml`). A **packaged** build defaults to `~/Documents/GetWrite` — visible, backup-friendly, and where writers look — with a per-user override recorded in `userData/workspace.json` (`resolveProjectsDir` = override ?? default). A development build keeps using the repo's `projects/`. Packaged builds previously stored projects under `process.resourcesPath` — inside `GetWrite.app` — where a drag-to-Applications update silently destroyed every project and runtime writes invalidated the bundle's code signature. `migrateLegacyProjectsDir` drains each `legacyProjectsDirs()` entry on every packaged launch, never overwriting an existing entry and never deleting on failure. Changing the location needs a restart, because `GETWRITE_PROJECTS_DIR` is fixed when the Next server is forked.
- Build flow: `pnpm electron:build` (frontend `next build` → electron `tsc`); package with `pnpm electron:package` (electron-builder).
- Logs go to `app.getPath("logs")/getwrite.log` in production.

### CLI (`cli/`)

Bundled to `cli/dist/bin/getwrite-cli.cjs` via `pnpm cli:build` (esbuild, Node target). Built on `commander`. Commands:

- `getwrite-cli project create [projectRoot] --spec <specPath> [-n <name>]` — Scaffold a new project from a project-type JSON spec (delegates to `project-creator.ts`).
- `getwrite-cli prune [projectRoot] [--max <n>]` — Delete oldest non-canonical revisions until at most `--max` (default 50) remain per resource. Logic in `pruneExecutor.ts`.
- `getwrite-cli reindex [projectRoot]` — Rebuild inverted index + backlinks + entity mention index from scratch by re-scanning all resources. Use after bulk filesystem changes that bypassed the save path.
- `getwrite-cli templates save|create|duplicate|list <projectRoot> …` — Manage resource templates under `<projectRoot>/meta/templates/`.
- `getwrite-cli screenshots capture [-b <storybook-url>] [-o <out-dir>] [-l <limit>]` — Playwright-driven full-page screenshots of every Storybook story.
- `getwrite-cli doctor [projectRoot]` — Check a project for broken folder associations (orphaned resources/folders). Logic in `cli/src/commands/doctor.ts`.
- `getwrite-cli qa start|verify|record|report|finish` — Developer-facing agentic QA harness (MVP, on-demand, not wired into CI): `start` creates a disposable out-of-tree workspace and spawns a dev server against it on a free port; `verify <kind> …` (kinds: `project-manifest`, `resource-content`, `resource-sidecar`, `revision`) checks a UI-reported outcome against on-disk ground truth; `record <status>` logs an outcome with no filesystem check (`unreachable`/`unverified`/`fail` — `pass` must be earned via `verify`); `report` writes `specs/features/agentic-qa/run-report.md` reconciled against `specs/features/agentic-qa/inventory.md`; `finish` stops the server and retains the workspace on any failure/unverified item. Inventory scope is projects, resources, and revisions only. Logic in `cli/src/qa/`; spec and operating procedure in `specs/features/agentic-qa.md` / `specs/features/agentic-qa/procedure.md`.

Set `GETWRITE_CLI_TESTING=1` to suppress `process.exit` when invoking commands from tests.

### Android Shell (`android/`) — ADR-021, Phase 0-2

Capacitor Android sibling to `electron/` — see [ADR-021](docs/architecture/ADRs/adr-021-native-android-via-capacitor-in-process.md). As of Phase 2 the real app boots in the WebView; `pnpm --filter getwrite-android build` itself is still a scaffold placeholder (it does not drive the app build below).

- `capacitor.config.ts`'s `webDir` points at `../frontend/out` — the frontend's real static export output, not a placeholder.
- The app build lives on the frontend side: `frontend`'s `pnpm build:native` (`GETWRITE_BUILD_TARGET=native`, `frontend/scripts/build-native-static.mjs`) assembles a generated native app tree — a copy of `app/` with `app/api/**` and the hosted-auth pages (`app/login`, `app/reset-password`, `app/verify-email`) removed — in a shadow root (`frontend/.native-build/`, never mutating the real `frontend/app/`), then runs `next build` from there with `output: "export"` (`frontend/next.config.mjs`, gated on `GETWRITE_BUILD_TARGET === "native"`; `standalone` otherwise). The export lands directly at `frontend/out/`. `frontend/app/(app)/layout.tsx` short-circuits the hosted-auth redirect gate on native. `frontend/.browserslistrc` pins Chrome >= 67, the effective WebView JS-parsing floor.
- `frontend/getwrite-config` is a **generated, gitignored** link to the repo-root `getwrite-config/`, letting static project-type-template imports resolve at a consistent relative depth from both the real tree and the shadow build root. It is created by `frontend/scripts/ensure-config-link.mjs` (run via `postinstall`, `prebuild`, `pretypecheck`, and the native build) — a real symlink on POSIX and a directory junction on Windows (needs no admin / `core.symlinks`), so it is cross-platform-safe and not committed as a fragile git symlink.
- `pnpm --filter getwrite-android build` currently just logs a placeholder message — there is no real Gradle build wired up yet.
- CI: `.github/workflows/build-android.yml` runs that placeholder build on every push/PR to `main` as a non-launch build-health check; it does not exercise `frontend`'s `build:native` or `next build --output export`.
- On the frontend side, the native runtime path (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GETWRITE_RUNTIME === "native"`) is served by a root-layout client-only `NativeBootstrap` component calling `frontend/src/lib/models/native-bootstrap.ts` + `capacitor-filesystem-real.ts` (see Code Map above), plus the generalized transport-collapse across the whole data layer — as of Phase 1 covering `store/`'s seven transports, and as of Phase 2 extended onto all nine `src/lib/api/*` modules and `project-actions-controller.ts` (see the Store section's Transports bullet); `frontend/next.config.mjs`'s `turbopack.resolveAlias` substitutes `node:*`-free web-stubs for each native backend's dynamic-import specifier so none of them enter the web/desktop build.

## Glossary

Domain terms that recur across code, skills, and specs:

- **Resource** — A user-authored unit (text document, image, link, etc.). Stored as `projects/<projectId>/resources/<resourceId>/` with `content.txt` + `content.tiptap.json`.
- **Sidecar** — A resource's metadata file at `projects/<projectId>/meta/resource-<resourceId>.meta.json`. Read/written via `sidecar.ts`.
- **Canonical revision** — The single revision per resource with `isCanonical: true` (enforced by `revision-canonical-guards.ts`). It's the one the editor loads and autosaves to.
- **Revision** — A snapshot under `projects/<projectId>/revisions/<resourceId>/v-<N>/`. `pruneRevisions` deletes oldest non-canonical revisions, keeping at most `--max` per resource (default 50 via the `prune` CLI).
- **Project type** — A JSON spec under `getwrite-config/templates/project-types/` describing folder layout, default metadata fields, and resource templates for a new project (e.g. `novel_project_type.json`).
- **Metadata schema** — Per-project field definitions (custom user-defined fields plus built-ins from `default-metadata-schema.ts`).
- **Smart folder** — A saved query (from `querySlice` / `saved-queries.ts`) rendered as a folder-like row in the resource tree.
- **Stub resource** — A resource the UI flags as "Needs content" (zero word count). Rendered with `isStub` in lists like `StubResourcesSection`.
- **Backlinks** — Reverse links between resources, computed by `backlinks.ts` and persisted to `meta/backlinks.json`.
- **Entity** — A resource explicitly declared as such via its sidecar's `entityKind` field (an open, user-definable string like `"character"` or `"place"`, not an enum) plus an optional `aliases` array of alternate names. Declared in `EntitySidecarFieldsSchema` (`schemas.ts`).
- **Mention** — A prose occurrence of an entity's name or one of its aliases, detected by `entity-detection.ts` (word-boundary, possessive, and simple-plural matching) and recorded with its character offset. A mention is _detected_, never authored — distinct from an explicit link (see Backlinks), which is authored. The two are stored separately and only ever merged for display, never conflated (`mentions-core.ts`).
- **Mention index** — The persisted mention index at `meta/index/mentions.json` (`mention-index.ts`), keyed by `resourceId` and invertible to `entityId` → mentioning resources. Rebuilt incrementally on save by `indexer-queue.ts` and from scratch by the `reindex` CLI.
- **Alias** — An alternate name for an entity, declared in its sidecar `aliases` array and matched by `entity-detection.ts` alongside the entity's `name`. Two entities claiming the same normalized alias are flagged ambiguous by `entity-alias-table.ts`; very short or common-word aliases are flagged, non-blockingly, by `entity-alias-warnings.ts`.
- **Entity highlighting** — A view-layer-only decoration in the editor (`EntityHighlightDecorationExtension.ts` / `entityHighlightDecoration.ts`) that visually marks an entity's name/alias occurrences in the live, unsaved ProseMirror document as one of two states — plain match, or "needs attention" (ambiguous claim and/or a short/common-word alias). Distinct from a Mention: it never reads or writes the mention index or any persisted state, and it produces no data of its own — only CSS decorations recomputed on each document-changing transaction. Gated behind the `entityHighlighting` project feature flag (itself dependent on `entities`).
- **Entity-scoped compile** — Compiling every resource associated with a declared entity — the same merged Mention + Backlinks set `EntityMentionsSection.tsx` renders — into a single ordered document, ordered by resource-tree position (depth-first, siblings by `orderIndex`; `orderResourceIdsByTreePosition` in `compileSelection.ts`). Triggered from the entity's own sidebar view via `CompilePreviewModal.tsx`'s entity mode, distinct from the whole-project/subtree compile flow in `AppShell.tsx`. Export-only: it reuses the existing compile client functions and writes nothing.
- **Trash** — Soft-delete area at `projects/<projectId>/.trash/` with `resources/` and `meta/` subtrees. `softDeleteResource` moves a resource's content directory and sidecar there, preserving IDs.
- **Hosted auth** — GetWrite's opt-in, hosted-only identity layer (better-auth + PostgreSQL, `lib/auth/`; see [ADR-020](docs/architecture/ADRs/adr-020-hybrid-auth-postgres-better-auth.md)). Active only when `DATABASE_URL` and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` are both set (`isHostedAuthActive()`); plugs into the `IdentitySource` seam (`betterAuthIdentitySource`) that resolves a request's `userId` for tenant storage isolation. Desktop/local never configures it and stays account-free and database-free.

## Standards & Authority Hierarchy

When resolving conflicts, precedence is: **specs (`specs/`) → existing code → `docs/standards/*` → explicit instructions → conventions**

Key standards (read these before making significant changes):

- `docs/standards/typescript-implementation.md` — No `any`, explicit types, pure functions, single responsibility
- `docs/standards/testing.md` — Test structure and node version requirements
- `docs/standards/template-integrity.md` — Minimal patch-style edits to template-derived files
- `docs/standards/storybook-implementation.md` — Component documentation requirements
- `docs/standards/code-documentation.md` — Code documentation conventions
- `docs/standards/package-selection.md` — Guidance on adding dependencies
- `docs/standards/storage-context.md` — Request-scoped `StorageContext` seam: when routes/CLI/background jobs must establish it
- `docs/standards/security.md` — Fail-closed defaults, no client-supplied paths, boundary validation, tenancy, crypto, secrets
- `docs/standards/accessibility.md` — WCAG 2.1 AA target, semantic roles, keyboard operability, a11y test conventions

## Styling

Brand name: **GetWrite** (one word, camelCase). Parent brand: **Saboteur LLC**.

- **Color tokens**: `black`, `white`, `red` (#D44040), `mid`, and `surface` variants
- **Red is reserved** for position/canonical state indicators only — never for actions or alerts
- **Typography**: IBM Plex Sans (UI), IBM Plex Mono (code), IBM Plex Serif (editor body only)
- **Editor line height**: 1.8+ minimum — this is essential for writers
- Dark/light mode support via CSS tokens defined in `styles/`
- Tailwind CSS 4 with brand tokens extended in theme config

Detailed styling guidance exists in STYLING.md

## Testing & Storybook

- Unit / integration / component / a11y tests live in `tests/`; prefer TDD and add to an existing test file before creating a new one.
- E2E tests (`e2e/`, Playwright, Chromium only) run against Storybook — start `pnpm storybook` (port 6006) first. Screenshots/video/trace are captured on failure. A11y tests use `@storybook/addon-a11y`.
- **Never hallucinate component props.** Before using any prop on an in-project component, open its source under `frontend/components/...` and matching `*.stories.tsx` to confirm it exists. Story names may not match prop names — verify against the TypeScript props or a story's args. If undocumented, ask rather than guess.
