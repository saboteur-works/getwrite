/**
 * @module mentions-core
 *
 * Transport-agnostic reads over the mention index (see `mention-index.ts`,
 * Task 4). Two directions are exposed, matching FR-9 and FR-10 of
 * `specs/features/entity-layer.md`:
 *
 * - {@link getResourceMentions} — "which entities does this resource
 *   mention" (FR-9), read via the index's native `resourceId` key.
 * - {@link getEntityMentionedIn} — "which resources mention this entity,
 *   with a snippet per occurrence" (FR-10), read via
 *   {@link invertMentionIndex}.
 *
 * Both are pure reads: neither writes to the mention index nor triggers
 * (re)detection. Detection itself is the indexer-queue's responsibility
 * (FR-7/FR-8), not this module's.
 *
 * **Task 15 addition — merging in explicit links (FR-12) and ambiguity
 * (FR-14).** `getEntityMentionedIn` is the one place an entity's detected
 * mentions and its explicit `linkedFrom` backlinks need to appear together
 * as a single list (FR-12: "wherever this list and the entity's explicit
 * backlinks appear together..."), so rather than add a second route/
 * transport/native-backend pair (a full ADR-021 plumbing set) purely to
 * fetch `linkedFrom` for one resource, this function now reads the already-
 * persisted `backlinks.json` (`loadBacklinks`, degrades to `{}` when
 * missing, same as the mention index) and merges explicit linkers into the
 * same result set, keyed by `resourceId` so a resource that is both linked
 * and mentioned appears exactly once with both flags set. This keeps the
 * existing route/transport/native-backend untouched — no new plumbing layer
 * — while satisfying FR-12's merge requirement at the one call site that
 * needs it.
 *
 * Ambiguity (FR-14) is likewise derived here rather than exposed via a new
 * client-facing read of `entity-alias-table.ts`'s `claimedBy` map:
 * `indexer-queue.ts` already records a mention against *every* claiming
 * entity when an alias is ambiguous, and it does so by re-running
 * `findMentionOffsets` per entity — so an ambiguous occurrence surfaces as
 * two (or more) `MentionRecord`s for the *same* `resourceId` and the *same*
 * character offset, one per claiming `entityId`. `resolveAmbiguousWith`
 * below detects this directly from the already-loaded `MentionIndex` by
 * checking, for each of our entity's occurrence offsets, whether any other
 * entity's record for that resource also claims that exact offset. No new
 * index, field, or route is needed for this — the ambiguity is already
 * latent in the persisted mention data once two entities share a term.
