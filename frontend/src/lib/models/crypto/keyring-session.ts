/**
 * @module crypto/keyring-session
 *
 * The one place an unlocked {@link Keyring} lives for the life of a session.
 *
 * **It is a module, not Redux state, and that is deliberate.** `CryptoKey`
 * handles are not serialisable, and putting key material in the store would put
 * it in devtools, in any state snapshot, and in whatever a future persistence
 * middleware decides to write down. `cryptoSlice.ts` holds only what the UI
 * needs to render — absent, locked, or unlocked — and never a key.
 *
 * FR7 in three parts:
 *
 * - *One unlock opens everything* — a single passphrase derives the workspace
 *   key, which unwraps every project's data key at once.
 * - *Memory only* — nothing here writes; `keyring-store.ts` persists wrapped
 *   material, which is not secret.
 * - *Discarded on lock and exit* — {@link lockSession} locks the keyring itself
 *   rather than merely dropping the reference, so anything still holding one
 *   finds it unusable. Process exit frees the memory inherently.
