/**
 * @module crypto/enable-encryption
 *
 * Turning encryption on for one project, end to end.
 *
 * Four steps, in an order that matters:
 *
 * 1. Establish the workspace keyring — created from a new passphrase the first
 *    time, reused from the unlocked session afterwards.
 * 2. Generate and persist this project's data key.
 * 3. Record its name in the sealed index, so the Start screen can list it
 *    lazily once unlocked (FR21).
 * 4. Sweep the project into ciphertext (`convert-project.ts`).
 *
 * The key is persisted *before* any file is sealed. The reverse order would
 * leave a window where a crash produces ciphertext no key can open — the one
 * unrecoverable failure this feature can actually cause.
 *
 * `resumeInterruptedConversions` finishes anything a crash left half-done.
 * Because the sweep is idempotent it needs no special recovery path: it simply
 * runs again, skipping whatever is already sealed (FR22).
