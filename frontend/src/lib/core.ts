/**
 * @module core
 *
 * Public "core" API surface — the framework-free model/logic layer consumed by
 * non-frontend packages (currently the standalone `getwrite-cli`). It is the
 * single import boundary those packages depend on, so they never deep-import
 * frontend internals.
 *
 * This barrel deliberately pre-stages the future extraction of these modules
 * into a standalone `@gw/core` package: when that happens, this file becomes
 * the package entrypoint and consumers' imports stay unchanged. See
 * docs/architecture/ADRs/adr-016-cli-extraction-and-deferred-core-package.md.
 *
 * Keep this surface intentional: add a named re-export only when an external
 * consumer needs it. Use named (not `export *`) re-exports for the additions
 * below because some modules share symbol names (e.g. both `backlinks` and
 * `pruneExecutor` export `listResourceIds`).
