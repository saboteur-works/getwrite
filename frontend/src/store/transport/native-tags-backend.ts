/**
 * @module store/transport/native-tags-backend
 *
 * **ADR-021 Phase 2 (Task 4).** The in-process implementation of
 * {@link TagsTransport} for a native (Capacitor) build: instead of
 * `fetch('/api/project/tags')`/`fetch('/api/project/tags/delete')`/
 * `fetch('/api/project/tags/assign')`, it invokes the *same*
 * transport-agnostic tags CRUD core the HTTP route uses
 * (`lib/models/tags-crud-core.ts`). There is no server and no HTTP — the
 * exact same business logic runs directly in the WebView process.
 *
 * This module is imported *only* on the native path (see
 * `lib/api/tags.ts`'s dynamic import), because it pulls in the server-side
 * tags core and storage layer, which must never enter the web client
 * bundle.
 *
 * **Storage context binding.** Every operation runs through the shared
 * `createNativeRunner(deps)` helper (`native-runner.ts`): `deps.fs` (tests)
 * binds a one-off {@link runInStorageContext} scope over the injected fake;
 * in production it awaits the memoized native bootstrap
 * (`ensureNativeStorageContext()` — context bound + projects dir created) and
 * resolves against the ambient default {@link StorageContext}, with no
 * per-operation rebinding.
 *
 * **`list`/`listAssignments` degrade-to-`[]` parity.** The HTTP transport's
 * `list`/`listAssignments` never throw — a failed or 404 request resolves to
 * `[]`, matching `lib/api/tags.ts`'s original `listTags`/
 * `listTagAssignments` bodies. This backend preserves that by swallowing
 * any error the core throws and resolving to `[]` instead.
 *
 * **`create`/`remove`/`assign` fire-and-forget parity.** The HTTP
 * transport's `create`/`remove`/`assign` never inspect `fetch`'s response —
 * a failed request resolves silently. This backend preserves that by
 * swallowing any error the core throws, rather than rejecting.
