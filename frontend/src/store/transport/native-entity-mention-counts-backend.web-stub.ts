/**
 * @module store/transport/native-entity-mention-counts-backend.web-stub
 *
 * **ADR-021 seam — web-build substitute.** Mirrors
 * `native-entity-alias-table-backend.web-stub.ts` and
 * `native-mentions-backend.web-stub.ts`. Turbopack cannot statically prove
 * that `lib/api/entity-mention-counts.ts`'s
 * `await import("../../store/transport/native-entity-mention-counts-backend")`
 * branch is unreachable in the hosted/desktop build (the branch's guard is
 * a runtime env comparison, and Turbopack resolves dynamic `import()`
 * targets into the module graph regardless of surrounding control flow).
 * The real `native-entity-mention-counts-backend.ts` transitively imports
 * `node:path` and the storage layer via the shared mentions core, none of
 * which Turbopack's client/SSR chunking context supports — hence the
 * substitution.
 *
 * This stub is never actually invoked:
 * `resolveEntityMentionCountsTransport()` only calls into the native branch
 * when `NEXT_PUBLIC_GETWRITE_RUNTIME === "native"`, which is never true for
 * the hosted/desktop builds this alias applies to. It exists solely to give
 * Turbopack a real, `node:*`-free module to resolve in place of the native
 * backend, satisfying the same export shape.
 *
 * Tests and `tsc` resolve the *real*
 * `native-entity-mention-counts-backend.ts` directly (this alias is a
 * Turbopack-only resolution rule, not a TypeScript path or module remap),
 * so this stub does not affect type coverage or test behavior.
 *
 * **Wiring note:** this file exists ahead of the later task that wires the
 * `next.config.mjs` `turbopack.resolveAlias` entry to keep the module
 * structurally consistent with the real backend created in this task (Task
 * 3) — see that later task's "Done when".
