/**
 * @module entityHighlightDecoration
 *
 * Pure, framework-agnostic core for the entity-highlighting feature
 * (`specs/features/entity-highlighting.md`, Task 8). Given a ProseMirror
 * document and a project's `EntityAliasTable`, computes the ranges where a
 * declared entity's name or alias occurs in the live document, classified
 * into exactly one of the two FR-10 visual states.
 *
 * This module does not import `@tiptap/pm/view` or `@tiptap/core` — it
 * returns plain data (`EntityHighlightRange[]`), not `Decoration`/
 * `DecorationSet` objects, so the actual TipTap extension wrapper (Task 9)
 * can turn ranges into decorations however it needs to. It mirrors how
 * `buildWikiLinkDecorations` in `./WikiLinkDecoration.ts` is a plain
 * function driven by a plugin's `state.init`/`apply`, except this module
 * stops one layer short of building `Decoration` instances.
 *
 * ## Matching strategy (OQ-1 mitigation)
 *
 * `frontend/tests/entityHighlightBenchmark.test.ts` (Task 7) measured that,
 * at the spec's worst-case corpus (500 declared terms / 5,000-word
 * document), calling `findMentionOffsets` once per declared term costs
 * ~137ms — over 2.7x the recorded 50ms no-visible-lag threshold
 * (`specs/features/entity-highlighting/oq1-benchmark-notes.md`). This module
 * instead builds a single combined alternation regex across every declared
 * term and scans each document text block once, which the same benchmark
 * measured at ~1.9ms for the identical worst case — comfortably under
 * threshold. The combined regex reuses `entity-detection.ts`'s exported
 * `ATTACHED_CHAR_CLASS`/`POSSESSIVE_OR_PLURAL_SUFFIX`/`escapeRegExp` building
 * blocks so its case-insensitive/word-boundary/possessive/simple-plural
 * envelope stays byte-for-byte faithful to `findMentionOffsets`'s semantics
 * rather than re-deriving them.
 *
 * A combined regex only tells us where a match starts and ends, not which
 * declared term produced it. `attributeMatch` recovers that by re-checking
 * the matched text (case-insensitively) against the same term list, longest
 * first — safe because a term can only ever win the regex alternation if its
 * case-insensitive text is a genuine prefix of the match subject to the same
 * boundary rules the whole combined pattern already enforced, so the
 * re-check cannot select a term the regex itself would have rejected.

 *
 * A normalized term may be claimed by more than one entity (ambiguous

 * but a single combined-regex match of the term in the document can't know
 * which claiming entity's "use" it actually is — that's exactly why
 * ambiguous-claim terms get flagged in the first place. So `isWarned` is
 * computed once per claiming entity (that entity's own
 * `dismissedNoiseTerms` alongside the shared `projectSources`), and the
 * term's final `isWarned` is `true` if *any* claiming entity's check comes
 * back `true` — never AND. A term only stops being flagged once every
 * entity that could plausibly be the one meant here has individually
 * dismissed it. For the common case (a term claimed by exactly one entity),
 * this reduces to that one entity's own dismissal state.
