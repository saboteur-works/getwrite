  // rules are relaxed here, and only here, because they fire on the CSF
  // format itself rather than on anything wrong:
  //
  //   - `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`: Storybook invokes a story's `render`
  //     as a component, but the rule only sees a lowercase function property
  //     and reports every hook inside it. 82 such reports, none of them a
  //     real hook-order problem. Rewriting each render body into a named
  //     component would be a large mechanical diff across fixtures for no
  //     behavioural gain; a genuine hook bug in a story still surfaces as a
  //     broken story in the Storybook build and the e2e run.
  //   - `react/no-unescaped-entities`: story fixtures are full of prose with
  //     apostrophes and quotation marks. The rule guards against ambiguity in
  //     shipped UI copy; these strings are sample content.
