/**
 * Encryption exercised the way a *request* exercises it.
 *
 * `enable-encryption.test.ts` and its siblings pass a plain adapter explicitly.
 * That is the right shape for testing the sweep, but it means none of them
 * touches the adapter production actually runs on: `with-storage-context.ts`
 * binds `workspaceEncryptionAdapter`, and every crypto module that defaults to
 * `getStorageAdapter()` therefore gets the *encrypting* adapter, not the plain
 * one its documentation requires.
 *
 * That gap hid a bug that made encrypting a second project impossible while
 * every existing test passed — the same failure shape as the FR12 defect
 * recorded in ADR-022: a seam that is correct in isolation and wrong once
 * adopted.
 *
 * So these tests bind the adapter exactly as the route does and pass no
 * `adapter` argument anywhere. If a crypto module reaches for the ambient
 * adapter again, something here fails.
