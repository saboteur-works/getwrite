/**
 * @module AppLayout
 *
 * Page-route protection for the authenticated app shell (Slice 6, FR20).
 *
 * This is the `(app)` route group's layout — a Next.js parenthesized
 * segment, which does not affect the URL (`/` still resolves to
 * `app/(app)/page.tsx`). The group exists specifically so `/login` (added in
 * a later task as a sibling of `app/(app)/`, not inside it) is never subject
 * to this redirect gate, while every current and future page under
 * `app/(app)/` is.
 *
 * An `async` server component with no `"use client"` directive, so it runs
 * in the Node runtime rather than the Edge runtime — required because the
 * session read it performs is database-backed (Postgres, via
 * `getAuthServer()`), and Edge cannot open that connection; this is FR20's
 * own stated rationale for a Node-runtime layout instead of Edge middleware.
 * It mirrors `withStorageContext`'s wrapper pattern in spirit — a single
 * seam every protected surface routes through before anything downstream
 * runs — even though it is structurally a layout rather than a function
 * wrapper, since page navigation has no single exported handler to wrap the
 * way an API route does.
 *
 * The actual "should this request redirect" decision is
 * `session-guard.ts`'s {@link shouldRedirectToLogin}, kept as a separately
 * unit-tested pure/async function; this component is intentionally a thin
 * wrapper around it: read inbound headers via `next/headers`'s `headers()`
 * (a `Promise` in this Next.js version, hence the `await`), ask the helper
 * whether to redirect, and either `redirect("/login")` (`next/navigation`)
 * or render `children`.
