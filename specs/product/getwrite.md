## Overview

GetWrite is a local-first, filesystem-backed writing workspace for long-form,
structured projects — novels, serials, scripts. Writers working in this shape
are served badly by note-taking tools (which handle fragments but not a
manuscript's shape) and by dedicated structured-writing tools (which trap the
work in proprietary containers and offer no queryable layer over the writing
itself). GetWrite's value is that a long-form project can be structured,
annotated, and interrogated — via a typed, queryable metadata layer — while
remaining a plain directory of files the writer owns outright, with no
database and, on desktop, no server and no account.

The product is released and versioned: the current release is **2.1.0**
(tag `getwrite-v2.1.0`, released 2026-08-18, per
`.release-please-manifest.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`). This release-version
axis is separate from the milestone buckets below (Shipped / In Progress /
Next / Later), which track product maturity, not release numbers — the two
are not to be conflated. The desktop product is live and in use, not a
speculative or pre-1.0 effort; the Later-milestone items in this spec are
planned expansions of an already-shipped product, not the product's first
version.

## Goals

- A writer can scaffold a structured, multi-resource project from a
  declarative project type and see it as real folders and files on disk.
- A writer can author in a rich-text surface that autosaves into a single,
  always-present canonical revision, with prior revisions retained and
  diffable.
- A writer can attach typed metadata to any resource — an always-on Status
  field, five further built-in fields switched on per project, and any field
  they define themselves, including reference fields scoped to a folder of
  their choosing — and query across all of it.
- A writer can search full text across a project, filter by metadata, and
  follow backlinks between resources.
- A writer can compile a selected subtree into a single manuscript file
  (PDF, DOCX, or text) with predictable, rule-based ordering.
- The product achieves real desktop adoption by writers currently using
  Scrivener or plain-file/Obsidian-style workflows, not merely a working demo.

## Non-goals

- **Not a note-taking or PKM system.** GetWrite assumes a manuscript, not a
  graph of atomic notes.
- **Not a real-time collaborative editor.** Two people never edit the same
  project: collaboration and shared-project multi-user access are permanent
  non-goals, not a future maybe. Multi-device access for a single writer
  (the same writer reaching the same projects from more than one device) is
  a different, planned capability — see FR-30 and FR-32 — and is not
  collaboration.
- **Not a layout or typesetting tool.** Compile produces a manuscript, not a
  designed book interior.
- **Not a publishing or distribution platform.** The product's surface ends
  at export.
- **Not an AI writing assistant.** No generation or rewriting features are
  in scope at any milestone in this spec.
- Hosted multi-tenant access and Android are addressed only as later
  milestones (see Functional Requirements); this spec does not treat them as
  shipped even though technical foundations exist. They are pursued on a
  fixed calendar horizon in parallel with desktop work, not gated on desktop
  adoption metrics.
- **Shared-project multi-user access is out of scope.** Resolved: hosted
  GetWrite is sync for one writer across devices, never collaboration
  between two people on one project (see FR-32 for the multi-device sync
  conflict model this implies).

## Users

**Scrivener-frustrated novelists**
Writers who want Scrivener-grade project structure, corkboard, and compile
without a proprietary `.scriv` container or its aging interface.
**Key need:** Structured, multi-scene project management without format lock-in.
**Success looks like:** They can rebuild their existing workflow's structure
and compile step in GetWrite and stop needing Scrivener day to day.

**Plain-file-ownership writers**
Writers from Obsidian/markdown workflows who insist on inspectable,
scriptable, backup-friendly files but have outgrown a flat note graph.
**Key need:** Chapters, scenes, ordering, and compile on top of files they
still fully own.
**Success looks like:** They can open the project folder in any other tool
and lose nothing if GetWrite disappears, while getting compile and structure
a note vault can't offer.

**Working writers on deadline** (secondary)
Writers for whom compile and revision history are daily instruments, not
reassurance.
**Success looks like:** Compile output is clean enough to send to an agent
or publisher without manual cleanup, and revision history reliably recovers
lost work.

## User Stories

**Scrivener-frustrated novelists**
- US-1: As a novelist, I want to scaffold a new project from a declarative
  project type so that I get a working folder structure immediately. [Shipped]
- US-2: As a novelist, I want to compile a selected subtree of my project
  into a single manuscript file so that I can produce a deliverable draft. [Shipped]
- US-3: As a novelist, I want to link my scenes to the contents of a folder
  I choose, so that I can track who and what appears where — whether that
  folder holds characters, locations, factions, or anything else my project
  needs. [Shipped]
- US-4: As a novelist migrating from Scrivener or Word, I want to import my
  existing project into GetWrite so that I don't have to manually
  re-create its structure. [Later]

**Plain-file-ownership writers**
- US-5: As a plain-file writer, I want to have every resource stored as an
  inspectable file with a sidecar metadata file so that I can read or script
  my project outside GetWrite. [Shipped]
- US-6: As a plain-file writer, I want to move a resource without breaking
  its metadata associations so that reorganizing costs nothing. [Shipped]
- US-7: As a plain-file writer, I want to search full text with metadata
  filters and follow backlinks so that I can navigate a project too large to
  hold in memory. [Shipped]
- US-8: As a plain-file writer, I want to install a signed desktop build
  so that I can trust and use the app day to day. [In Progress]

**Working writers on deadline**
- US-9: As a writer on deadline, I want to autosave into a single canonical
  revision while retaining history so that I never lose work and can always
  see what changed. [Shipped]
- US-10: As a writer on deadline, I want to view a diff between revisions so
  that I can evaluate an edit before keeping it. [Shipped]
- US-11: As a writer on deadline, I want to browse and restore soft-deleted
  resources so that an accidental delete is recoverable without a filesystem
  detour. [Next]
- US-12: As a writer on deadline, I want to reach the same project from
  another device so that a project isn't bound to one machine. [Later]
- US-13: As a writer on deadline, I want to save and reuse resource
  templates so that I can create new resources with consistent structure
  without rebuilding it each time. [Shipped]
- US-14: As a writer on deadline, I want to define metadata fields beyond
  the built-in schema so that I can track attributes specific to my
  project. [Shipped]
- US-15: As a writer on deadline, I want to create, open, rename, delete,
  and package projects from a start page so that I can manage my whole
  project lifecycle without leaving the app. [Shipped]
- US-16: As a writer on deadline, I want to encrypt my project at rest on
  desktop or Android so that my files remain private if my device is lost
  or accessed by someone else. [Shipped]

## Functional Requirements

### Shipped Requirements

- FR-1: The product MUST persist all projects, resources, and metadata as
  files/directories on the local filesystem, with no database. [US-5]
- FR-2: Users MUST be able to create a project from a declarative project
  type that defines the initial folder layout and starter resources. [US-1]
- FR-3: Resource identity MUST be independent of file path; moving a
  resource MUST NOT break its metadata associations. [US-6]
- FR-4: The editor MUST autosave text edits, debounced, into the resource's
  canonical revision without creating a new revision on every save. [US-9]
- FR-5: Every resource MUST have exactly one canonical revision at all
  times, and a resource MUST NOT be left without at least one revision. [US-9]
- FR-6: The current canonical revision MUST NOT be deletable; other
  revisions MAY be deleted, subject to the max-revisions-per-resource
  pruning configuration. [US-9]
- FR-7: Users MUST be able to view a word-based diff between the current
  canonical revision and any other retained revision of a text resource. [US-10]
- FR-8: A multi-reference metadata field MUST be scopeable to a folder by
  folder **id**, never by folder name, chosen per field in the schema manager
  from every folder in the project plus an "Any folder" option, optionally
  including descendants. Single-reference fields are unscoped and draw on all
  resources. No folder name carries application semantics. A project type MAY
  additionally record an `isMetadataSource` flag and a `metadataInputType`
  against a folder. This is a **superseded** mechanism: until the
  schema-driven sidebar rewrite (`cc04767`, 2026-05-17) the sidebar selected
  folders by that flag and generated a reference row per folder, choosing the
  control from `metadataInputType`. The rewrite replaced folder-driven
  rendering with the per-field `refFolder` model above. The authoring control
  and the persistence remain; no consumer does. It therefore confers no
  privilege today.
  Deleting a resource that is referenced elsewhere MUST NOT remove the
  reference entry; it MUST nullify the reference (retaining `{id: null, name}`
  in place) rather than delete the entry, including within multi-reference
  arrays. [US-3]
- FR-9: Text resources MUST support the built-in metadata schema. Exactly one
  field is unconditional: Status, a locked, project-scoped select whose
  options come from the project type and are user-editable and reorderable.
  Five further built-in fields — Synopsis, Notes, Point of View (a single
  resource reference that also accepts free text, preserved as a name with a
  null id when no resource is linked or when a linked resource is later
  deleted), and the Timeline group's Story Date, Duration and Story End Date
  (stored with no ordering validation between start and end) — are each
  governed by a per-project feature toggle and are **hidden unless that
  toggle is on**; an absent flag reads as disabled. Toggling a field off hides
  its control without discarding stored values. Reference fields for entities
  such as characters, locations, or items are NOT built-ins — they are
  user-defined schema fields (FR-20), optionally folder-scoped (FR-8). [US-3]
- FR-10: Users MUST be able to save a metadata query and have it appear in
  the resource tree as a smart folder. [US-7]
- FR-11: Users MUST be able to search full text across all resources in a
  project and filter results by folder, Status, and Tags. [US-7]
- FR-12: The product MUST maintain a backlinks index between resources that
  reference one another. [US-7]
- FR-13: The work area MUST provide five views — Edit, Organizer, Data,
  Diff, and Timeline — each rendering the selected resource or folder per
  its type (text/image/audio/mixed). Timeline is gated behind a per-project
  `timelineView` feature flag and is disabled unless that flag is on;
  enabling it force-enables the timeline date fields, an invariant enforced
  at the feature-config write seam so the view can never be on without the
  data it reads. [US-9][US-10][US-7]
- FR-14: Compile MUST produce a single PDF, DOCX, Markdown, or text manuscript from a
  user-selected subtree of the resource tree, walking it depth-first with
  siblings ordered by their resource-tree position (plain resource-tree
  order, as arranged by the user); compile MUST NOT emit metadata and MUST
  NOT mutate revisions or project state. [US-2]
- FR-15: The product MUST ship as an account-free desktop application
  (Electron) that runs against the local filesystem with no server
  dependency. [US-5]
- FR-16: The product MUST support dark and light mode with a per-project
  color-mode preference. [US-5]
- FR-17: Users MUST be able to add image and audio resources through the UI
  via a type selector and file input in the create-resource flow, plus
  editor drag-and-drop; both feed a dedicated media viewer. [US-3]
- FR-18: The product MUST support project-scoped tags that can be created,
  assigned to and removed from resources, and deleted, with management UI
  in the sidebar and a tag manager modal; tags cannot be renamed at any
  layer (model or UI) — renaming a tag requires deleting and recreating it,
  which drops its existing resource assignments. [US-7]
- FR-19: Users MUST be able to save, create from, duplicate, and list
  resource templates via the CLI, producing reusable scaffolds for new
  resources; this capability is CLI-and-model-only — there is no UI and no
  HTTP route. A separate, richer template CLI (export/import to `.zip`,
  scaffold, validate, preview, version, changeset) exists in the source tree
  but is not wired into the shipped `getwrite-cli` binary and is reachable
  only from tests; it MUST NOT be treated as a shipped capability. [US-13]
- FR-20: Users MUST be able to define and manage custom metadata field
  definitions per project through a schema manager UI, beyond the built-in
  fields: add, edit, and delete field definitions; rename a field's label;
  rename a field's key with a migration preview; change a field's type with
  migration; reorder fields; and choose between deprecating and clearing a
  field as distinct removal semantics, with a preview of select-option
  removal before it is applied. Only the built-in `status` field is
  locked: it cannot be renamed, retyped, reordered, or removed, though its
  options are project-supplied and user-editable. Every other built-in field
  is unlocked at load time and is editable exactly like a user-defined field —
  `locked` protects a field definition, not its option list. [US-14]
- FR-21: Users MUST be able to reorder resources and folders via
  drag-and-drop, with order persisted to disk, and MUST have context-menu
  actions to create, rename, copy/duplicate (a single behavior offered
  under both labels), delete, convert to smart folder, and export tree
  nodes. [US-6]
- FR-22: The editor MUST provide TipTap-based WYSIWYG rich-text editing with
  a config-driven toolbar, heading/body styling, tables, and paste
  normalization. [US-9]
- FR-23: Users MUST be able to create, open, rename, delete, and package
  projects from a start page; package compiles selected project resources
  to PDF, DOCX, Markdown, or text — it is not a project-level zip export.
  [US-15]
- FR-24: The product MUST render a lightweight hover preview — the
  referenced resource's stored name plus the first 8 characters of its id,
  or "Deleted" if the reference is broken — when a resource reference is
  selected in the QueryBuilder value picker. This preview does not load the
  referenced resource's content and shows no excerpt or thumbnail, and
  resource-ref fields in the Metadata Sidebar have no hover preview at all.
  [US-7]
- FR-25: The product MUST support per-project, opt-in end-to-end encryption
  on desktop and native Android: a workspace keyring with an unlock/lock
  session lifecycle, sealed (AES-256-GCM, Argon2id-derived) file bodies for
  project content, crash-safe and resumable conversion between plaintext
  and encrypted storage in both directions, and a plaintext export escape
  hatch. This capability is scoped to desktop and native Android only; the
  hosted deployment excludes it behind a fail-closed, server-side gate (see
  Constraints). [US-16]
- FR-35: Users MUST be able to declare a resource as an entity and give it
  one or more alternate names, after which every prose mention of that
  entity's name or alternate names anywhere else in the project MUST be
  attributed to it automatically, without a manual link. Detection MUST be
  deterministic and MUST run fully offline, consistent with the
  local-first architecture and the native Android build. The product MUST
  let a writer see, per resource, which entities it mentions, and, per
  entity, every resource that mentions it, so that appearance lists and
  per-entity mention indexes are computed rather than hand-maintained; it
  MUST also let a saved query or smart folder filter resources by entity
  mention. The product MUST NOT infer an entity the writer never declared,
  and MUST NOT perform pronoun or coreference resolution. [US-3]

### In Progress Requirements

- FR-26: Organizer view MUST support filtering cards by Status, by word
  count, and by the resource-reference fields a project defines (the
  characters and locations folders the fiction templates provide being the
  common case); no card filtering of any kind exists today. Organizer's only
  in-view control is a show/hide-bodies toggle — though what a card body
  renders (nothing, a text excerpt of configurable length, or any metadata
  field) is a separate per-project setting that already ships. [US-7]
- FR-27: Desktop builds MUST be signed and installable without an OS
  security warning on macOS and Windows. [US-8]

### Next Requirements

- FR-28: Users MUST be able to browse, restore, and permanently purge
  soft-deleted resources through a dedicated Trash UI (the underlying
  restore/purge model already exists). [US-11]
- FR-29: Search MUST become able to find matches across all retained
  revisions of a resource, not only its canonical revision (today only the
  canonical revision is indexed and searched — see Constraints); when a
  user opens the diff view from such a result, the diff MUST consistently
  select the most recent matching revision. [US-7]
- FR-36: Users MUST be able to toggle a working mode that visually marks every
  declared entity's name and aliases inline in the editor, so that the
  entities present in a passage are apparent at a glance without opening a
  sidebar panel or running a search. The highlight MUST be view-layer only
  and MUST NOT alter persisted resource content in any way. The toggle state
  MUST persist per project. Detection MUST run fully offline and
  deterministically, consistent with the local-first architecture and the
  native Android build. The feature MUST reuse the entity declarations (name
  and aliases) already established by FR-35 and MUST NOT introduce any new
  mechanism for declaring an entity. [US-3]
- FR-37: Users MUST be able to select a declared entity and compile every
  resource associated with it into a single, ordered document, so that they
  can read that entity's whole thread as one continuous pass — a
  consistency-check read-through — rather than following mention links one
  at a time. The resource set MUST be the same merged set
  `mentions-core.ts`'s `getEntityMentionedIn` already builds for the
  entity's own "mentioned in" view — both detected prose mentions (the
  `mentions` query intrinsic, FR-35) and explicit `linkedFrom` backlinks —
  so the compiled pass is never narrower than the association list the user
  sees when they invoke it. Ordering MUST be resource-tree position,
  depth-first with siblings ordered by `orderIndex`, filtered to only the
  resources in that merged set — the same rule FR-14 uses for subtree
  compile, applied here as new work rather than inherited: `compile-core.ts`
  performs no ordering of its own, and FR-14's depth-first ordering is
  produced upstream by `compileSelection.ts`'s `getDescendantLeafIds`. If a
  project is not organized in story order, the compiled output will not be
  in story order either; this is an accepted consequence, consistent with
  FR-14's subtree compile having the same property. Entity-scoped compile
  MUST remain export-only and MUST NOT mutate revisions, entity
  declarations, or the mention index, consistent with the existing compile
  constraint. [US-2][US-3]

### Later Requirements

- FR-30: The product SHOULD ship hosted, multi-device access to the same
  project data as a user-facing product. The foundations already ship —
  per-user tenant resolution, a production better-auth identity source, full
  auth UI (login/verify-email/reset-password), a pluggable object-store
  backend, route-level tenant enforcement tests, and a live-infra smoke
  harness — but no user-facing multi-device product exists yet. This is
  pursued on a fixed calendar horizon in parallel with desktop work, not
  gated on desktop adoption metrics. [US-12]
- FR-31: The product SHOULD replace the JSON inverted index with a durable
  search backend once it demonstrably bottlenecks on large projects. [US-7]
- FR-32: The product SHOULD define a conflict-resolution model for a single
  writer's offline edits made from multiple devices to the same project (a
  sync, not collaboration, conflict model), as part of the hosted
  multi-device work in FR-30. [US-12]
- FR-33: The product SHOULD offer an importer for existing Scrivener
  (`.scriv`) or Word/DOCX projects, converting them into a GetWrite project
  structure. This is a real, planned feature belonging here in Later, not
  in Out of Scope. [US-4]
- FR-34: The product SHOULD extend full-text search filtering to the saved
  query builder's predicates — its intrinsics (word count, character count,
  created/updated dates, tags, inbound and outbound links) and any
  user-defined schema field, including reference fields sourced from
  metadata-source folders — joining the two currently-separate filter
  surfaces. Full-text search has no predicate over those fields today, and
  the saved-query builder has no full-text-over-content predicate. [US-7]

## Constraints

- Folder names carry no application semantics: any folder layout is valid,
  and no folder is protected from rename, delete, move, or reordering. A
  Workspace-folder invariant was considered earlier in the product's
  history and was deliberately removed; it is not planned to return as a
  special-named-folder mechanism.
- The single-canonical-revision invariant must hold at all times; no
  feature may leave a resource with zero or more than one canonical
  revision.
- Resource identity must remain independent of on-disk path for the life of
  the project; no feature may rely on path as identity.
- The desktop build must remain fully functional with no network access and
  no account.
- No import path currently exists from Scrivener (`.scriv`) or Word/DOCX
  projects; this is a known adoption risk not met by any shipped, in
  progress, or next requirement — an importer is a planned Later
  requirement (FR-33).
- Compile is export-only and must never mutate revisions or project state.
- Full-text search indexes and searches only each resource's canonical
  revision today; retained revisions remain browsable and diffable but are
  not searchable until FR-29 ships.
- `frontend/src/lib/models/previews.ts` (image/audio/text preview
  generation) has zero production consumers; no requirement in this spec
  relies on it, and it must not be described as a shipped capability.
- End-to-end encryption (FR-25) is offered only on desktop and native
  Android; the hosted deployment excludes it behind a fail-closed,
  server-side gate (`crypto/encryption-availability.ts`). Offering it on
  hosted before the model layer runs client-side would be a padlock whose
  key the server holds, so the gate is deliberate rather than a gap to
  close.
- The on-disk layout uses UUID-named directories for path-independent
  identity; this is a known tension with the "open your folder and see your
  files" ownership claim and is not resolved by this spec.
- Any hosted/multi-device work must not compromise the local-first, no-account
  desktop experience that is the stated basis for adoption. Hosted and
  Android work is not gated on desktop adoption metrics: both are timeboxed
  to a fixed calendar horizon and pursued as parallel-track investment
  alongside desktop work.
- Observability: the product collects no telemetry and must continue to collect
  none — there is no analytics or crash-reporting dependency in the tree, and the
  only outbound call on the desktop path is the opt-in GitHub release check.
  Diagnostics are a local log file (`app.getPath("logs")/getwrite.log`). A hosted
  deployment may add server-side health checks and structured logs, but nothing
  that reports a local user's activity off their machine.
- Performance: no performance budget is currently measured anywhere — there are
  no latency targets, benchmarks, or performance gates in CI. The one identified
  scaling limit is the whole-file JSON inverted index, which is expected to
  bottleneck on large projects (FR-31). This constraint records the absence
  deliberately: a target nobody measures is not a commitment, and any future
  budget should arrive with the measurement that enforces it.
- Hosted GetWrite's data model must support multi-device sync for a single
  writer without supporting multi-user collaboration on a shared project;
  see FR-32.

## Open Questions

**OQ-1: What is the licensing and distribution posture — open source, paid,
freemium?**
**Impact:** Affects positioning and any future feature gating; not
addressed by any requirement in this spec.
**Owner:** Product owner / business.
**Evidence:** Verified: no `LICENSE` file exists in the repository. The
root `package.json` declares `"license": "ISC"`, but this is `npm init`
scaffolding rather than a deliberate licensing decision — the other three
workspace packages (`frontend`, `electron`, `cli`) declare no `license`
field at all, which is inconsistent with a real, intentional choice having
been made.

## Out of Scope (Deferred)

- [Later] Hosted multi-tenant access and cross-device sync as a shipped,
  user-facing product (foundations exist per ADR-017–ADR-022; not shipped).
- [Later] Native Android packaging, signing, and distribution as a shipped
  release channel. The in-process app itself is complete — 15 native
  transport backends collapse every client→server call in-process, a real
  Capacitor filesystem bridge, native bootstrap, and a `build:native`
  static-export pipeline, running inside a real Gradle project
  (`android/android/{build,settings}.gradle`, `app/build.gradle`) — but
  `pnpm --filter getwrite-android build` is a placeholder log statement and
  CI exercises only that placeholder, not a real packaged build.
- Multi-user real-time collaborative editing, and multiple users on a
  shared project generally — a permanent non-goal, not a future milestone
  (resolved: see Non-goals and Constraints).
- [Exploring] Mobile/tablet-optimized responsive layout as a complete
  experience (partial implementation exists).
- [Exploring] Expanded resource-template CLI command set (export/import to
  `.zip`, scaffold, `--vars`, inspect, validate, preview, version,
  changeset) — this exists in the source tree (`cli/src/templates.ts`) but
  is not wired into the shipped `getwrite-cli` binary and is reachable only
  from tests (see FR-19).
