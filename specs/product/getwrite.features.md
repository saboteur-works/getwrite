# Feature Breakdown: GetWrite

**Source:** `specs/product/getwrite.md` (`sab.product-spec/1`)
**Status key used throughout:** every feature title and Notes field states one
of **Shipped**, **Partial** (started, real work remains), or **Not started**.
GetWrite is at release 2.1.0; most of this list already exists in the
product. Only the **Not started** entries are real candidates for a future
`/saboteur-ship` feature-selection gate — the **Shipped** entries are
inventory, not backlog, and the **Partial** entries are the closest thing to
a small next slice.

This breakdown regenerates the prior version against a spec that went through
a second accuracy correction. Corrections carried into this document — do not
reintroduce the claims below:

- **Search across revisions is Not started, not Shipped.** Search reads only
  each resource's canonical revision today. FR-29 (Next milestone) now merges
  "search across all retained revisions" with "the diff view opened from such
  a result selects the most recent matching revision" into a single
  requirement; this breakdown reflects that merge as one feature rather than
  two.
- **Tags cannot be renamed at any layer.** There is no rename path in the
  model or the UI; renaming means delete-and-recreate, which drops existing
  assignments.
- **The Start page has no copy action**, and package does not produce a zip —
  it compiles selected resources to PDF, DOCX, Markdown, or plain text.
- **Reference previews were overstated.** What ships is a hover tooltip in
  the QueryBuilder value picker only — a referenced resource's name plus a
  short id, or "Deleted." It never loads the referenced resource's content.
  `models/previews.ts` has zero production consumers and backs no shipped
  claim.
- **Tree context menu** ships `rename` and `convert to smart folder` in
  addition to create/copy-duplicate/delete/export; `copy` and `duplicate` are
  one behavior under two labels, not two behaviors.
- **Resource templates are CLI-and-model-only.** No UI, no HTTP route. The
  richer `cli/src/templates.ts` (export/import/scaffold/validate) is not
  wired into the shipped binary and must not be described as shipped.
- **End-to-end encryption (FR-25) is newly added** to this breakdown — a
  substantial shipped subsystem the prior version omitted entirely.

There is no Workspace folder invariant and no named special folders (Front
Matter/Back Matter/Workspace) anywhere in this document; a reference field is
scoped to whichever folder its schema definition names, by folder id.

---

### Feature 1: Local-first, database-free project persistence — Shipped
**Value:** A writer's projects, resources, and metadata are always plain
files/directories they own, never rows in a database they can't inspect.
**Vertical slice:** Filesystem storage layout, `StorageAdapter`/`io.ts`
boundary, project directory conventions, all persisted-state schemas.
**Requirements covered:** FR-1
**User stories:** US-5
**Depends on:** none
**Branch suggestion:** feat/local-first-persistence
**Notes:** Shipped. Foundational — every other feature in this list writes
through this layer. Verified against `frontend/src/lib/models/io.ts` and the
`projects/` on-disk layout described in CLAUDE.md.

### Feature 2: Project scaffolding from a declarative project type — Shipped
**Value:** A novelist gets a working, structured folder layout the moment
they create a project, instead of starting from an empty tree.
**Vertical slice:** `project-creator.ts`, project-type JSON specs under
`getwrite-config/templates/project-types/`, Start page create-project flow.
**Requirements covered:** FR-2
**User stories:** US-1
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/project-type-scaffolding
**Notes:** Shipped.

### Feature 3: Path-independent resource identity — Shipped
**Value:** A plain-file writer can reorganize their project tree without
breaking any metadata association tied to a resource.
**Vertical slice:** UUID-keyed resource identity, sidecar metadata storage
keyed by ID rather than path, move/rename handling across the tree.
**Requirements covered:** FR-3
**User stories:** US-6
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/path-independent-identity
**Notes:** Shipped.

### Feature 4: Autosave into a single canonical revision — Shipped
**Value:** A writer on deadline never loses work and never has to think
about saving — edits land in one authoritative revision automatically, and
the current revision can never be deleted out from under them.
**Vertical slice:** Debounced autosave, canonical-revision invariant
enforcement (exactly one canonical revision at all times), delete guard
against removing the current canonical revision, revision-pruning
configuration.
**Requirements covered:** FR-4, FR-5, FR-6
**User stories:** US-9
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/canonical-autosave
**Notes:** Shipped.

### Feature 5: Revision diff view — Shipped
**Value:** A writer on deadline can see exactly what changed before
deciding whether to keep an edit.
**Vertical slice:** Word-based diff algorithm, Diff view UI, revision
selection for comparison.
**Requirements covered:** FR-7
**User stories:** US-10
**Depends on:** Feature 4
**Branch suggestion:** feat/revision-diff-view
**Notes:** Shipped.

### Feature 6: Folder-scoped references and reference integrity — Shipped
**Value:** A novelist can point a multi-reference field at any folder — by
folder id, never by name — and a deleted-but-referenced resource never
silently vanishes from where it's cited.
**Vertical slice:** Per-field `refFolder` scoping chosen in the schema
manager, offering every folder plus an "Any folder" option and an
include-descendants toggle; single-reference fields are unscoped. The
`isMetadataSource` folder flag is a superseded mechanism: the sidebar
generated a reference row per flagged folder until the schema-driven rewrite
(`cc04767`) replaced that with per-field `refFolder`. It is still authored in
the project-type editor and written onto the folder, but nothing consumes it. Reference-nullification on delete (`{id: null, name}`
retained, including within multi-reference arrays) rather than removal.
**Requirements covered:** FR-8
**User stories:** US-3
**Depends on:** Feature 2
**Branch suggestion:** feat/metadata-source-folders
**Notes:** Shipped. No folder name carries application semantics — this
replaces any earlier notion of named special folders (Characters/Locations/
Items/Front Matter/Back Matter/Workspace), none of which exist in the
codebase as protected or name-recognized folders today.

### Feature 7: Typed resource metadata — Shipped
**Value:** A novelist can attach structured, queryable facts to any resource
instead of relying on prose or ad hoc tags.
**Vertical slice:** The built-in metadata schema. Status is the only
unconditional field — a locked, project-scoped select whose options come from
the project type and are user-editable and reorderable. Synopsis, Notes,
Point of View (single resource reference accepting free text, preserved as a
name with a null id), and the Timeline group's Story Date, Duration and Story
End Date (unvalidated start/end ordering) are each behind a per-project
feature toggle and hidden while it is off, with stored values retained.
Entity reference fields such as characters or locations are not built-ins —
see Feature 18 (user-defined fields) and Feature 6 (folder scoping). Sidecar
persistence; Metadata sidebar UI.
**Requirements covered:** FR-9
**User stories:** US-3
**Depends on:** Feature 6
**Branch suggestion:** feat/typed-resource-metadata
**Notes:** Shipped.

### Feature 8: Saved queries as smart folders — Shipped
**Value:** A plain-file writer can save a metadata query once and reuse it
as a live, always-current folder in the tree.
**Vertical slice:** Query AST/evaluator, `saved-queries.ts`, QueryBuilder
UI, smart-folder rendering in the resource tree.
**Requirements covered:** FR-10
**User stories:** US-7
**Depends on:** Feature 7
**Branch suggestion:** feat/smart-folders
**Notes:** Shipped.

### Feature 9: Full-text search with metadata filters — Shipped
**Value:** A plain-file writer can find anything in a project too large to
hold in memory, by text and by Status/folder/Tags together.
**Vertical slice:** Inverted index, indexer queue, SearchBar UI, filter
panel (folder, Status, Tags).
**Requirements covered:** FR-11
**User stories:** US-7
**Depends on:** Feature 7
**Branch suggestion:** feat/full-text-search
**Notes:** Shipped. Indexes and searches only each resource's canonical
revision — retained revisions are not searchable until FR-29 (Feature 27)
ships. Full-text search's own filters are folder/Status/Tags only; it has no
predicate over the query builder's fields today (see Feature 32).

### Feature 10: Backlinks index — Shipped
**Value:** A plain-file writer can navigate a project by following actual
references between resources rather than remembering where things are.
**Vertical slice:** Wiki-link parsing, `backlinks.ts` maintained index,
backlink surfacing in the UI.
**Requirements covered:** FR-12
**User stories:** US-7
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/backlinks-index
**Notes:** Shipped.

### Feature 11: Five-view work area (Edit/Organizer/Data/Diff/Timeline) — Shipped
**Value:** A writer sees the resource or folder they've selected rendered
the way that's useful for the task at hand, not one fixed layout.
**Vertical slice:** Work area shell, per-view components, type-aware
rendering dispatch (text/image/audio/mixed).
**Requirements covered:** FR-13
**User stories:** US-9, US-10, US-7
**Depends on:** Feature 4, Feature 5, Feature 9
**Branch suggestion:** feat/work-area-views
**Notes:** Shipped as a base slice. Timeline is gated behind a per-project
`timelineView` feature flag and is disabled unless it is on; turning it on
force-enables the timeline date fields at the feature-config write seam, so
the view can never be on without its data. Organizer's only in-view control
is a show/hide-bodies toggle — though what a card body renders (nothing, a
text excerpt, or any metadata field) is a per-project setting that ships.
Card *filtering* by Status, word count, or reference fields is entirely
unbuilt and is broken out separately as Feature 24 (Not started), not folded
into this entry's Shipped status.

### Feature 12: Compile to a single manuscript — Shipped
**Value:** A novelist produces one ordered, deliverable manuscript file
from a chosen subtree without manual assembly.
**Vertical slice:** Depth-first compile walking a user-selected subtree in
plain resource-tree order, PDF/DOCX/Markdown/text output, non-mutating compile
pipeline, Compile preview modal.
**Requirements covered:** FR-14
**User stories:** US-2
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/compile-manuscript
**Notes:** Shipped. Compile has no notion of Workspace/Front Matter/Back
Matter ordering — it walks whatever subtree the user selects, in tree order,
and never emits metadata or mutates revisions/project state.

### Feature 13: Account-free Electron desktop app — Shipped
**Value:** A writer runs GetWrite entirely offline, with no server and no
account, against their own filesystem.
**Vertical slice:** Electron shell, standalone Next.js server spawn,
`GETWRITE_PROJECTS_DIR` resolution, packaged-build project directory.
**Requirements covered:** FR-15
**User stories:** US-5
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/electron-desktop-app
**Notes:** Shipped.

### Feature 14: Dark/light mode with per-project preference — Shipped
**Value:** A writer sets a color mode per project that persists rather than
resetting to a global default.
**Vertical slice:** CSS token themes, per-project `colorMode` preference
storage, theme switch UI.
**Requirements covered:** FR-16
**User stories:** US-5
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/color-mode-preference
**Notes:** Shipped.

### Feature 15: Add image and audio resources via the UI — Shipped
**Value:** A novelist adds an image or audio resource directly from the
app instead of placing files on disk out of band.
**Vertical slice:** Type selector and file input in the create-resource
flow, upload route, editor drag-and-drop, dedicated media viewer.
**Requirements covered:** FR-17
**User stories:** US-3
**Depends on:** Feature 7
**Branch suggestion:** feat/media-resource-creation
**Notes:** Shipped end-to-end — create-flow, upload route, editor drag-drop,
and media viewer all exist.

### Feature 16: Project-scoped tags — Shipped
**Value:** A plain-file writer organizes resources with lightweight,
project-scoped labels, independent of the metadata schema.
**Vertical slice:** Tag creation/assignment/removal/deletion model layer,
sidebar tag management UI, tag manager modal.
**Requirements covered:** FR-18
**User stories:** US-7
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/project-tags
**Notes:** Shipped. Tags cannot be renamed at any layer — model or UI.
Renaming a tag means deleting and recreating it, which drops its existing
resource assignments; this is a real gap, not a UI-only omission, and any
future rename capability would be new scope, not a fix to this feature.

### Feature 17: Resource templates via CLI — Shipped
**Value:** A writer on deadline creates new resources with consistent
structure without rebuilding it each time, via the CLI.
**Vertical slice:** `getwrite-cli templates save|create|duplicate|list`,
template scaffolds under `meta/templates/`.
**Requirements covered:** FR-19
**User stories:** US-13
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/resource-templates-cli
**Notes:** Shipped, CLI-and-model-only — no UI, no HTTP route. The richer
`cli/src/templates.ts` (export/import to `.zip`, scaffold, validate,
preview, version, changeset) exists in the source tree but is not wired
into the shipped `getwrite-cli` binary and is reachable only from tests; it
is not shipped and must not be claimed as such.

### Feature 18: User-definable metadata schema — Shipped
**Value:** A writer on deadline tracks attributes specific to their project
beyond the built-in metadata fields, and can safely evolve that schema as
the project grows.
**Vertical slice:** Custom field-definition model, per-project schema
storage, Schema Manager UI covering add/edit/delete field definitions,
label rename, key rename with a migration preview, type-change migration,
field reordering, and deprecate-vs-clear removal semantics with a
select-option-removal preview.
**Requirements covered:** FR-20
**User stories:** US-14
**Depends on:** Feature 7
**Branch suggestion:** feat/custom-metadata-schema
**Notes:** Shipped. Only `status` is locked — it cannot be renamed,
retyped, reordered, or removed, though its options are project-supplied and
user-editable. Every other built-in is unlocked at load time and is editable
exactly like a user-defined field.

### Feature 19: Resource-tree drag-and-drop and context menu — Shipped
**Value:** A plain-file writer reorders and manages resources/folders
directly in the tree, with order surviving to disk.
**Vertical slice:** Drag-and-drop reorder persisted to disk, context-menu
create/rename/copy-duplicate/delete/convert-to-smart-folder/export actions.
**Requirements covered:** FR-21
**User stories:** US-6
**Depends on:** Feature 3
**Branch suggestion:** feat/tree-dnd-context-menu
**Notes:** Shipped. `copy` and `duplicate` are one behavior offered under
two menu labels, not two distinct behaviors.

### Feature 20: TipTap rich-text editing — Shipped
**Value:** A writer on deadline authors in a full WYSIWYG surface with
tables, heading/body styling, and clean paste behavior.
**Vertical slice:** TipTap-based editor, config-driven toolbar, paste
normalization.
**Requirements covered:** FR-22
**User stories:** US-9
**Depends on:** Feature 4
**Branch suggestion:** feat/tiptap-editor
**Notes:** Shipped.

### Feature 21: Start-page project management — Shipped
**Value:** A writer on deadline creates, opens, renames, deletes, and
compiles a package from their whole project lifecycle without leaving the
app.
**Vertical slice:** Start page UI, project create/open/rename/delete
actions, package action that compiles selected resources.
**Requirements covered:** FR-23
**User stories:** US-15
**Depends on:** Feature 2
**Branch suggestion:** feat/start-page-project-management
**Notes:** Shipped. There is no copy action on the Start page. Package
compiles selected project resources to PDF, DOCX, Markdown, or text — it is
not a project-level zip export.

### Feature 22: Reference hover preview in the QueryBuilder value picker — Shipped
**Value:** A plain-file writer selecting a resource reference in a saved
query sees enough to confirm it's the right one, without navigating away.
**Vertical slice:** Hover tooltip rendering in the QueryBuilder value
picker, showing a referenced resource's stored name plus the first 8
characters of its id, or "Deleted" if the reference is broken.
**Requirements covered:** FR-24
**User stories:** US-7
**Depends on:** Feature 8
**Branch suggestion:** feat/reference-hover-preview
**Notes:** Shipped, but narrowly scoped — this is a hover tooltip in one
surface only (the QueryBuilder value picker). It never loads the referenced
resource's content and shows no excerpt or thumbnail. Resource-ref fields in
the Metadata Sidebar have no hover preview at all.
`frontend/src/lib/models/previews.ts` has zero production consumers and
backs no part of this feature or any other shipped capability.

### Feature 23: Per-project end-to-end encryption — Shipped
**Value:** A writer on desktop or native Android keeps their project
private at rest — if the device is lost or accessed by someone else, the
files are unreadable without unlocking the workspace.
**Vertical slice:** Workspace keyring with an unlock/lock session
lifecycle, sealed (AES-256-GCM, Argon2id-derived) file bodies via an
`encryptingAdapter.ts` `StorageAdapter` decorator, crash-safe and resumable
bidirectional conversion between plaintext and encrypted storage
(`convert-project.ts`), a plaintext export escape hatch, and opt-in
enable/resume orchestration.
**Requirements covered:** FR-25
**User stories:** US-16
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/e2e-encryption
**Notes:** Shipped, and substantial — this was omitted from the prior
feature list entirely. Scoped to desktop and native Android only; hosted
excludes it behind a fail-closed, server-side gate
(`crypto/encryption-availability.ts`) because the model layer does not yet
run client-side there.

### Feature 24: Organizer view — card filtering — Not started
**Value:** A plain-file writer filters the Organizer's card view by the
facets that matter to them, instead of only being able to hide/show bodies.
**Vertical slice:** Filter-state model in Organizer view, filter UI
controls, query wiring for Status, word count, and the project's
resource-reference fields.
**Requirements covered:** FR-26
**User stories:** US-7
**Depends on:** Feature 11
**Branch suggestion:** feat/organizer-filters
**Notes:** Not started. Organizer ships no card filtering of any kind
today; its only in-view control is a show/hide-bodies toggle. (Configuring
what a card body renders is a separate setting that already ships — see
Feature 11.) Real candidate for the next `/saboteur-ship` selection gate.

### Feature 25: Signed, warning-free desktop installers — Partial
**Value:** A plain-file writer installs the desktop build on macOS or
Windows without an OS security warning undermining trust in the app.
**Vertical slice:** Code-signing and notarization pipeline (macOS),
Windows code-signing, electron-builder packaging config changes.
**Requirements covered:** FR-27
**User stories:** US-8
**Depends on:** Feature 13
**Branch suggestion:** feat/signed-desktop-builds
**Notes:** Partial — build and packaging already ship; signing/notarization
is outstanding (tracked separately in the user's Electron Distribution TODO).

### Feature 26: Trash UI — browse, restore, purge — Not started
**Value:** A writer on deadline recovers an accidentally deleted resource
from within the app, with no filesystem detour.
**Vertical slice:** Trash UI surface (list, restore action, purge action),
wiring to the existing restore/purge model functions.
**Requirements covered:** FR-28
**User stories:** US-11
**Depends on:** Feature 1
**Branch suggestion:** feat/trash-ui
**Notes:** Not started as a shipped, user-facing feature. The underlying
soft-delete model (`trash.ts`, `.trash/` directory, restore/purge functions)
already exists and is not itself gated by this feature — only the UI is
missing.

### Feature 27: Search across all retained revisions — Not started
**Value:** A plain-file writer finds a match that exists in an older
revision, not only the current canonical text, and lands on the right
revision when they open its diff.
**Vertical slice:** Revision-aware indexing, search-result surfacing across
retained revisions of a resource, and diff-view wiring that consistently
selects the most recent matching revision when a diff is opened from such a
result.
**Requirements covered:** FR-29
**User stories:** US-7
**Depends on:** Feature 5, Feature 9
**Branch suggestion:** feat/search-across-revisions
**Notes:** Not started. Today search indexes and reads only each resource's
canonical revision; retained revisions remain browsable and diffable but are
not searchable. This requirement merges what a prior version of this
breakdown treated as two separate features (search-across-revisions, and
correct revision-selection on diff-open) into one, matching the parent
spec's FR-29.

### Feature 28: Hosted multi-device access to the same project — Partial
**Value:** A plain-file writer reaches the same project from more than one
device instead of being bound to a single machine.
**Vertical slice:** Hosted tenancy/auth wiring for end-user access, sync
transport for project data, desktop/hosted parity for the writing surface.
**Requirements covered:** FR-30
**User stories:** US-12
**Depends on:** none
**Branch suggestion:** feat/hosted-multi-device-access
**Notes:** Partial. Per-user tenant resolution, a production better-auth
identity source, full auth UI (login/verify-email/reset-password), a
pluggable object-store backend, route-level tenant enforcement tests, and a
live-infra smoke harness all ship. What's missing is the user-facing
multi-device product itself. Pursued on a fixed calendar horizon in
parallel with desktop work, per the parent spec's constraints — not gated
on desktop adoption metrics.

### Feature 29: Durable search backend for large projects — Not started
**Value:** A plain-file writer with a very large project keeps fast search
even after the JSON inverted index would otherwise bottleneck.
**Vertical slice:** Replacement search backend, migration path from the
existing inverted index, no user-facing behavior change beyond performance.
**Requirements covered:** FR-31
**User stories:** US-7
**Depends on:** Feature 9
**Branch suggestion:** feat/durable-search-backend
**Notes:** Not started. Contingent on demonstrated bottlenecking, per the
parent spec's phrasing ("once it demonstrably bottlenecks") — not scheduled
against a fixed date the way Feature 28 is.

### Feature 30: Multi-device conflict-resolution model — Not started
**Value:** A plain-file writer whose device was offline gets their edits
merged predictably when it reconnects, instead of silently losing or
duplicating work — without any notion of another person editing the
project.
**Vertical slice:** Conflict-detection logic for offline edits from
multiple devices of the same writer, a defined resolution policy (to be
designed), and the sync transport hook that applies it.
**Requirements covered:** FR-32
**User stories:** US-12
**Depends on:** Feature 28
**Branch suggestion:** feat/multi-device-conflict-resolution
**Notes:** Not started, and undesigned — a single-writer sync conflict
model only; multi-user/collaboration conflict handling is a permanent
non-goal per the parent spec's Non-goals. Broken out as its own feature so
it is not silently absorbed into Feature 28's scope.

### Feature 31: Scrivener/Word project importer — Not started
**Value:** A novelist migrating from Scrivener or Word imports their
existing project structure into GetWrite instead of manually re-creating it.
**Vertical slice:** `.scriv` and DOCX parsers, mapping from source project
structure to GetWrite's project-type/resource-tree model, an import flow in
the UI or CLI that runs the conversion.
**Requirements covered:** FR-33
**User stories:** US-4
**Depends on:** Feature 2
**Branch suggestion:** feat/scrivener-docx-importer
**Notes:** Not started. Planned, not near-term — no committed milestone
slot yet. No import path exists today from either format, which is a known
adoption risk called out in the parent spec's Constraints.

### Feature 32: Join full-text search with saved-query predicates — Not started
**Value:** A plain-file writer filters by full-text content and by
the query builder's fields in the same search, instead of using two
disconnected surfaces.
**Vertical slice:** Shared predicate model spanning full-text search and
the saved-query builder, UI wiring so either surface can apply the other's
predicates.
**Requirements covered:** FR-34
**User stories:** US-7
**Depends on:** Feature 9, Feature 8
**Branch suggestion:** feat/join-search-and-query-predicates
**Notes:** Not started. Both surfaces ship independently today (Feature 9's
full-text search; Feature 8's saved-query builder) but have never been
joined — full-text search has no predicate over the query builder's fields,
and the saved-query builder has no full-text-over-content predicate.

### Feature 33: Entity layer — automatic prose-mention detection — Shipped
**Value:** A novelist who declares a resource as a character, place, or
object gets every prose mention of it across the whole project — by name or
alias — attributed automatically, instead of losing the connection the
moment they forget to bracket a manual link.
**Vertical slice:** A sidecar `entityKind` + ordered `aliases` schema
addition; case-insensitive, word-boundary-safe alias matching (with
possessive/plural forms) dispatched through the existing `indexer-queue` on
save; a new mention index persisted under `meta/index/`, separate from
`backlinks.json`; a `mentions` intrinsic field so saved queries and smart
folders can filter by entity mention; and two UI surfaces — a resource view
listing the entities detected in it, and an entity view listing every
mentioning resource with a snippet per occurrence, visually distinguished
from explicit links.
**Requirements covered:** FR-35
**User stories:** US-3
**Depends on:** Feature 7, Feature 9, Feature 10
**Branch suggestion:** feat/entity-layer
**Notes:** Shipped. Merged to `main` on 2026-08-25 as 19 commits tagged
`[task_ddb55116]`, from `7eb0e0fa` (spec + task list) to `df2e5554`; the
`feat/entity-layer` branch was rebased and deleted, so there is no merge
commit. This entry closes a ladder gap: a complete rung-4 feature spec
(`specs/features/entity-layer.md`) already existed for this capability but
had no rung-3 parent entry until now; the parent product spec has since been
amended with FR-35 to cover it. Detection runs fully offline and reuses
existing machinery (`indexer-queue`, `backlinks.ts`'s resolver maps,
`extractSnippet`) rather than introducing a new pipeline; it does not change
how explicit backlinks are computed or persisted.
The two UI surfaces ship behind an off-by-default per-project `entities`
feature flag (commit `df2e5554`), joining the existing Timeline / Point of
View / Synopsis / Notes flag family. The flag gates the UI only — detection,
the mention index, and the indexer path run ungated.
A follow-on repair shipped separately: `extractSidecarRefIds` read only one
level of the sidecar, so `resource-ref` / `multi-resource-ref` fields under
`userMetadata` never produced a backlink. Specified in
`specs/features/entity-linking.md` and landed under `[task_08553ca3]`.

### Feature 34: Entity highlighting in the editor — Not started
**Value:** A writer toggles a working mode that visually marks every declared
entity's name and aliases inline as they read a scene, so the entities in a
passage are apparent at a glance instead of requiring a trip to a sidebar
panel or a search. The highlight is a view-layer decoration only; it never
touches persisted content.
**Vertical slice:** A TipTap/ProseMirror decoration extension following the
existing `WikiLinkDecoration.ts` pattern (walk text nodes, emit
`Decoration.inline`, rebuild on `docChanged`), reusing the dependency-free
`entity-detection.ts` matcher client-side; a project-scoped endpoint exposing
the entity alias table to the client, with a native backend counterpart for
ADR-021 parity, a client cache, and invalidation on alias edits; and a
persisted toggle in per-project editor config.
**Requirements covered:** FR-36
**User stories:** US-3
**Depends on:** Feature 33
**Branch suggestion:** feat/entity-highlighting
**Notes:** Not started. Tracked as POS `task_4b2ec55f`, blocked by
`task_ddb55116`; findings in `note_3059fe58`. FR-36 covers this feature: the
parent product spec was amended to add a requirement for the toggleable
inline editor highlight, reusing the entity declarations FR-35 established
without introducing any new entity-declaration mechanism.
Two constraints established by reading the tree rather than assumed:
detection must run live over each text node, NOT off `meta/index/mentions.json`
— those offsets are into persisted plain text, while ProseMirror positions
count node boundaries, so they do not align, and the index is stale against
unsaved edits regardless. The entity-layer spec settled the opposite answer for its own surface: the
indexer reads only persisted, saved content, never unsaved editor state.
Reading live here is a deliberate difference for a different surface, not a
resolution of that question — a highlight of stale text would be wrong.
Unmeasured risk: `WikiLinkDecoration` runs one static regex per transaction,
whereas this runs N aliases against the document on every keystroke, and a
novel project may declare hundreds. Mitigations exist (single alternation
regex; rescan only the changed range) but the cost has not been benchmarked —
that measurement belongs in its task breakdown.
Scheduling argument: `entity-alias-warnings.ts` already flags short or
common-word aliases (such as "May" or "Will") non-blockingly at declaration
time, so the writer is not without warning; what the highlight adds is
showing the actual extent of such an alias's matches in running prose, which
a declaration-time warning cannot convey. Styling constraint: the brand
reserves red for
position/canonical indicators, so the highlight must use another token.

### Feature 35: Entity-scoped compile — Not started
**Value:** A novelist tracking a character or thread across a large project
compiles every resource associated with that entity into one continuous
document — the same consistency-check read-through Feature 12's whole-project
and subtree compile already offer, but scoped to an entity's thread instead
of a manuscript position, so they can review that entity across the whole
project without following mention links one at a time.
**Vertical slice:** A new resource-selection path that starts from
`mentions-core.ts`'s `getEntityMentionedIn` merged set (detected prose
mentions plus explicit `linkedFrom` backlinks) instead of a subtree
selection, then orders that set by resource-tree position, depth-first with
siblings by `orderIndex` — the same rule `compileSelection.ts`'s
`getDescendantLeafIds` applies for FR-14, reimplemented here over an
unordered entity/mention set rather than inherited, since neither
`invertMentionIndex` (arbitrary `Object.values` order) nor
`getEntityMentionedIn`'s merge orders its output that way. The ordered
resource-id list then feeds the existing `compile-core.ts` renderers
(`compilePdfCore` / `compileDocxCore` / `compileTextCore` /
`compileMarkdownCore`) unchanged, since they already render sections in
exactly the order the `resourceIds` argument arrives in; plus an entry point
in the entity view to invoke it. Export-only: no revision, entity
declaration, or mention-index write.
**Requirements covered:** FR-37
**User stories:** US-2, US-3
**Depends on:** Feature 33, Feature 12
**Branch suggestion:** feat/entity-scoped-compile
**Notes:** Not started. FR-37 covers this feature, added to the parent
product spec's Next Requirements. Four scope decisions are settled at the
product-spec gate and are not reopened here: the resource set is the merged
mentions-plus-backlinks set (not mentions alone), ordering is resource-tree
position depth-first by `orderIndex` (not chronological or mention-index
order), the feature is export-only, and it rides the existing `entities`
feature flag rather than introducing a new one — the compile entry point
lives inside the entity panel, which `MetadataSidebar.tsx:531-544` already
gates as a whole via `isEntitiesEnabled`, so the action is unreachable
without `entities` enabled and a dedicated flag would add nothing. (Feature
34's `entityHighlighting` nesting under `entities` is a UI-conditional
convention in `ProjectFeatureToggles.tsx:175-198`, not a schema-level
dependency the model layer enforces, and is not a rule this decision follows
— Feature 34 warranted its own flag because it is a persistent, always-on
rendering mode, where this feature is an on-demand, export-only action.) The
ordering bridge between the retrieval half (`mentions-core.ts`, existing) and
the render half (`compile-core.ts`, existing) is the genuinely new work.

## Summary

- Total features: 35
- Suggested build order: Features 1 through 23 are already shipped
  (foundational chain: 1 → 2 → 6 → 7 → {8, 9, 18} → {9 → 11, 10} → 11 → {4 →
  5 → 11, 20}; 3, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23 hang off earlier shipped
  features independently). Of the remaining work: 24 (Organizer filters), 25
  (signed installers), 26 (Trash UI), and 27 (search across revisions) are
  independently startable now. 28 (hosted multi-device access) must land
  before 30 (its conflict-resolution model, which depends on it). 29
  (durable search backend) is contingent on demonstrated need rather than
  sequenced by dependency. 31 (Scrivener/Word importer) only depends on the
  already-shipped Feature 2. 32 (joining search and query predicates)
  depends on the already-shipped Features 8 and 9. 33 (entity layer) has
  since shipped. 34 (entity highlighting) depends on 33 and is therefore
  independently startable now. 35 (entity-scoped compile) depends on the
  now-shipped 33 and the already-shipped 12, and is therefore independently
  startable now.
- Independently shippable: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
  16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35
  (30 is the only feature left with an unmet hard dependency — on 28 — since
  34's and 35's dependencies, 33 and 12, have both shipped)
- Risks: Feature 30 is undesigned — its Vertical slice describes a
  resolution policy still to be chosen, so its task breakdown will need a
  design decision before implementation tasks can be written. Feature 28 is
  the largest slice in this list (hosted tenancy + sync transport) and is
  likely to need its own further feature breakdown rather than a single
  task list, though substantial foundations already ship. Feature 31
  carries external-format-parsing risk (Scrivener's `.scriv` container
  format is undocumented by Scrivener itself) that may affect estimate
  confidence more than the other Not-started features. Feature 27 merges two
  previously separate concerns (revision-aware indexing and diff-open
  revision selection) per the parent spec's FR-29 correction; its task
  breakdown should confirm the merge doesn't hide two different sizes of
  work. Feature 34 carries an unbenchmarked per-keystroke cost (N aliases
  scanned per transaction, where a novel project may declare hundreds) that
  its task breakdown must measure rather than assume. Feature 35's ordering
  bridge (merged mention/backlink set → tree-position order) is new code with
  no existing analogue to reuse wholesale, unlike Feature 12's compile, which
  only needed the render half.

## Open Questions

None.

(OQ-1, on licensing/distribution posture, is tracked in the parent
product spec and does not affect this feature partition. Two previously
logged questions here have since been resolved by amendments to the parent
product spec: Feature 33 having no rung-2 functional requirement was
resolved when FR-35 was added, and Feature 34 having no requirement of its
own — it previously only extended FR-35's surface — was resolved when FR-36
was added; see each feature's Requirements covered field.)
